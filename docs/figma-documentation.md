# API Reference | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/api-reference/*

The API reference includes the resources and materials to navigate the Plugin API. You can explore the Plugin API using any of the entry points in the sidebar.

If youâre new to Figma or plugins, weâve outlined some of the key resources involved below. Make sure to read through our development guides for tips and best practices!

Global objects and variables
----------------------------

You can access most of the Plugin API through theÂ [`figma`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/)Â global object and its sub-objects. Youâll find properties and functions that allow you to view, create, and update the contents of files.

There are also global variables available across the Plugin API: [`__html__`](/plugin-docs/api/global-objects/#html) and [`__uiFiles__`](/plugin-docs/api/global-objects/#uifiles). You can use these variable to access the contents of your ui files.

[**Explore global objects and variables â**](/plugin-docs/api/global-objects/)

Node types
----------

In Figma, nodes are the way we represent the contents of a file. Every layer in a Figma design or FigJam file corresponds to a node.

Each node supports a range of properties. Some properties are universal, some are shared between nodes and some are unique to specific node types.

Select a [**Node type**](/plugin-docs/api/nodes/) to see which properties are supported on that node.

Node properties
---------------

Some node properties are supported across node types. You can use the [Shared Node Properties](/plugin-docs/api/node-properties/) section to explore these shared properties. We show which node types a property is supported on.

Data types
----------

To assist you with writing your plugin code, we provide a TypeScript [typings file](/plugin-docs/api/typings/) for the entire Plugin API. The typings file is a collection of type and interface declarations you can use for type checking.

These declarations represent groups of related properties, parameters, and other data youâll interact with in Figma. Youâll see types and interfaces in a few places in the API reference.

* To get and set properties on nodes or global objects
* Passed as parameters in a function
* Returned by a method

You can access types and interfaces from any properties and methods that use them. Or, you can explore types and interfaces in the [Data Types](/plugin-docs/api/data-types/) section of the sidebar.

Other resources
---------------

### Plugin manifest

Every plugin must define aÂ `manifest.json`Â file that describes the plugin. Figma creates a simple manifest when you register a plugin for development.

You can extend this manifest to take advantage of optional functionality. For example: accept plugin parameters, or create private plugins in an organization.

**[View plugin manifest properties â](/plugin-docs/manifest/)**

### Typings file

The API reference and documentation explain the structure of the the API and how it works. This is great when exploring the API or understanding supported features and functions.

We provide a [typings file](/plugin-docs/api/typings/) with type annotations for the entire Plugin API. When used with an editor, like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), this provides you with suggestions as you code. This helps to reduce errors and catch edge cases.

We also provide a set of [typescript-eslint rules](https://github.com/figma/eslint-plugin-figma-plugins?tab=readme-ov-file#eslint-plugin-figma-plugins) that ensure you're correctly using the Plugin API. The GitHub repository includes detailed instructions for installing and using the rules to test your plugin code.

You donât have to use TypeScript when developing plugins, but we strongly recommend you do! The API reference and all associated guides use it.

**[Set up TypeScript â](/plugin-docs/typescript/)**

ð¡ We update the typings file any time we make changes to the API. To get the latest typings, runÂ `npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings`.

# Plugin Manifest | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/*

Each plugin must define a `manifest.json` file that describes the plugin. If you use the "Create new plugin" dialog, Figma will automatically create a simple manifest for you. You can extend this generated manifest to take advantage of additional features, for example, to declare a submenu for your plugin.

Example:

manifest.json

```
{  
  "name": "MyPlugin",  
  "id": "737805260747778092",  
  "api": "1.0.0",  
  "editorType": ["figma", "figjam"],  
  "main": "code.js",  
  "ui": "ui.html",  
  "documentAccess": "dynamic-page",  
  "networkAccess": {  
    "allowedDomains": ["none"]  
  }  
}
```

### name: string

The name of the plugin, as it will appear in the menu.

---

### id: string

The plugin ID to publish updates to. This ID will be assigned to you by Figma and is typically obtained using the "Create new Plugin" feature, which will generate a manifest file with a new `id`. You can also get a new plugin ID at the time of publishing your plugin.

---

### api: string

The version of the Figma API used by the plugin. **We recommend updating to the latest version whenever possible** to get the latest features, bug fixes, and documentation. However, we don't auto-upgrade the api version of plugins to give you the chance to test your plugin against the new version.

---

### main: string

The relative file path to the Javascript code of your plugin.

---

### ui?: string | { [key: string]: string }

Used to specify HTML file/files that can be used in the iframe modal via [`figma.showUI`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-showui/), if you choose to have one.

* If a single string is specified, this is the relative file path to the HTML file whose contents will be available as a string in the Javascript code via the constant [`__html__`](/plugin-docs/api/global-objects/#html).
* If a map is specified, each entry of the map will be available at [`__uiFiles__`](/plugin-docs/api/global-objects/#uifiles)

---

### documentAccess?: 'dynamic-page'

This field ensures the plugin supports dynamic page loading. The field is required for all new plugins and the value must be `dynamic-page`.

* If the manifest field is included, no additional page loads will occur when the plugin is run.
* If the manifest field is omitted, then running the plugin will trigger additional page loads in files with more than one page. The first time the plugin is run after a user opens a file, the entire file will load and Figma will show a "Loading n pages for pluginâ¦" notification, where `n` is the number of pages being loaded.

If your existing plugin's manifest doesn't include this field, you should [migrate your plugin to use dynamic page loading](/plugin-docs/migrating-to-dynamic-loading/).

---

### networkAccess?: NetworkAccess

Used to specify the list of domains that your plugin is permitted to access. When `networkAccess` is used:

* Your plugin can only access the domains that you specify. If your plugin attempts to access other domains, the plugin is prevented from doing so.

  The enforcement of network access is limited only to requests made by the plugin, such as requests to a public API. In a situation such as a plugin rendering a website in a frame, network access limits only apply to the website's domain. Network access limits donât affect the websiteâs resources.
* The list of domains that your plugin can access is displayed on your plugin's Community page.

`networkAccess` has the following properties:

* `allowedDomains` is a required list of strings. The strings are match patterns for domains that your plugin is permitted to access. If `networkAccess` is used, `allowedDomains` must include at least one pattern. Optionally, patterns can start with one of the permitted schemes: `http`, `https`, `ws`, or `wss`. The `*` character may be used as a wildcard for subdomains, or used to represent all domains.
* `reasoning` is a usually-optional string that describes why your plugin needs to access the allowed domains. `reasoning` is required if:
  + Your `allowedDomains` list includes `"*"`
  + Your `allowedDomains` list includes local or development servers. If you only need local or development servers for development, please use `devAllowedDomains` instead.
* `devAllowedDomains` is an optional list of strings. The strings are match patterns for domains that your plugin is permitted to access during development. You can use most of the same patterns in `devAllowedDomains` as you can in `allowedDomains`.

Valid patterns for `allowedDomains`:

* `["none"]`: The plugin cannot access any external network resources. Note that we preload the Inter font for use in plugins, so you don't need to include an Inter font source in your allowedDomains.

Valid patterns for `allowedDomains` and `devAllowedDomains`:

* `["*"]`: The plugin may access any external network resources. If this pattern is included in `allowedDomains`, the `reasoning` property is required.
* `["*.example.com"]`: The `*` character can be used to permit all subdomains of a given domain.
* `["http://example.com", "https://example.com", "ws://example.com", "wss://example.com"]`: `http`, `https`, `ws`, and `wss` are permitted schemes that can be used to prefix domains. Other schemes, such as `file`, cannot be used.
* `["api.example.com/rest/get", "www.example.com/images/", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/example_bucket/"]`: URLs to specific resources can be used.
* `["example.com", "figma.com"]`: Domains can be used without schemes, subdomains, or wildcards.
* `["http://localhost", "https://localhost", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8081"]`: During development, the plugin can access a local/development web server. If the server is running on a port other than port 80, the port number can be provided after the URL. If this pattern is included in `allowedDomains`, the `reasoning` property is required.

In the previous example, the trailing slash in `www.example.com/images/` identifies a path to multiple resources. For example, `www.example.com/images/` lets a plugin access images at `www.example.com/images/img1.png` and `www.example.com/images/img2.png`.

A pattern with *no* trailing slash blocks any deeper access to files on that path. For example, `api.example.com/rest/get` stops a plugin from accessing `api.example.com/rest/get/exampleresource.json`. This can be useful, for example, if your plugin uses a REST API endpoint and you want to restrict the plugin to that endpoint only.

For example:

```
"networkAccess": {  
  "allowedDomains": [  
    "figma.com",  
    "*.google.com",  
    "https://my-app.cdn.com",  
    "wss://socket.io",  
    "example.com/api/",  
    "exact-path.com/content"  
  ],  
  "devAllowedDomains": [  
    "http://localhost:3000"  
  ]  
}
```

More formally,

```
interface NetworkAccess {  
  allowedDomains: string[]  
  reasoning?: string  
  devAllowedDomains: string[]  
}
```

---

### parameters?: Parameter[]

Used to specify the list of parameters that your plugin accepts as input. Can also be defined on [menu items](/plugin-docs/manifest/#menu). Here's an example:

```
"parameters": [  
  {  
    "name": "Icon name",  
    "key": "icon-name",  
    "description": "Enter the name of the icon you want to insert."  
  },  
  {  
    "name": "Size",  
    "key": "size",  
    "description": "Enter the size of the icon you want to insert.",  
    "allowFreeform": true  
  },  
  {  
    "name": "Color",  
    "key": "color",  
    "description": "Enter the color of the icon you want to insert.",  
    "allowFreeform": true,  
    "optional": true  
  }  
]
```

Each parameter has the following properties:

* A `name` property that specifies the name given to this parameter in the UI.
* A `key` property that is a unique id used to identify the value of this property in [`ParameterValues`](/plugin-docs/api/figma-parameters/#parametervalues).
* An optional `description` property that gives a more detailed description that is displayed in the UI.
* An optional `allowFreeform` property that allows the user to enter any value for this parameter, not just those suggested by the plugin.
* An optional `optional` property that indicates the parameter can be skipped in the UI.

More formally,

```
interface Parameter {  
  name: string  
  key: string  
  description?: string  
  allowFreeform?: boolean  
  optional?: boolean  
}
```

---

### parameterOnly?: boolean

Allows you to specify that your plugin can only be launched with parameters. You must also specify a valid parameter list: [`parameters`](/plugin-docs/manifest/#parameters).
Can also be defined on [menu items](/plugin-docs/manifest/#menu) with parameters.

If `true`, users will always be prompted to enter parameters in the quick action UI before your plugin is run.
If `false`, users will only be asked to enter parameters if they launch the plugin through the Quick Actions UI and hit the `tab` key. If the user launches the plugin through
the context menu or the main menu, the plugin will be launched directly without displaying the parameter UI.

Defaults to `true`

---

### editorType: ('figma' | 'figjam' | 'dev')[]

This allows you to specify the editor(s) that your plugin is intended for and will impact which editor your plugin appears in.

| editorType | description |
| --- | --- |
| `"figma"` | Figma design mode |
| `"figjam"` | FigJam |
| `"dev"` | Figma Dev Mode |

The following value is unsupported:

```
"editorType": ["figjam", "dev"]
```

---

This allows you to specify a submenu for your plugin, enabling the plugin to contain multiple commands. Use the [`figma.command`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#command) property to determine which command the user selected.

The `menu` property contains a nested list of menu items, menu separators and submenus to be displayed. Here's an example:

```
"menu": [  
  {"name": "Create Text", "command": "text"},  
  {"name": "Create Frame", "command": "frame"},  
  {"separator": true},  
  {"name": "Create Shape",  
   "menu": [  
     {"name": "Create Circle", "command": "circle"},  
     {"separator": true},  
     {"name": "Create Rectangle", "command": "rectangle"}  
   ]  
  }  
]
```

Each item in the `menu` property must be one of the following three:

* A `name` and a `command` property. This creates a user-clickable submenu item. The `name` property is displayed to the user in the menu. The `command` property is never exposed to the user but is rather exposed to your plugin through the `figma.command` javascript property. You can choose any string value for `command`.
* A `separator` property with the value `true`. This creates a separator in the menu. A separator is not selectable by the user.
* A `name` and a `menu` property. This creates a nested submenu. The `name` property is displayed as name for the submenu. The `menu` property contains an array of menu items following the same format of the top-most `menu` manifest property. The submenu itself can not be selected by the user, but items inside the submenu can be. Submenus can be nested arbitrarily deep.

More formally,

```
type ManifestMenuItem =  
    
  { name: string, command: string, parameters?: ParameterList[], parameterOnly?: boolean } |  
    
  { separator: true } |  
    
  { name: string, menu: ManifestMenuItem[] }
```

---

### relaunchButtons?: ManifestRelaunchButton[]

This configures the relaunch buttons that are set via the [`setRelaunchData`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/) API call.

Example:

```
"relaunchButtons": [  
  {"command": "edit", "name": "Edit shape"},  
  {"command": "open", "name": "Open Shaper", "multipleSelection": true}  
]
```

Each relaunch button in the `relaunchButtons` array is an object with the following properties:

* A `command` property that specifies the `figma.command` that will be supplied when the plugin is run after the button is pressed. This command must match the command supplied in the [`setRelaunchData`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/) API call for the button to display.
* A `name` property that gets displayed as the text of the button.
* An optional `multipleSelection` property (defaulting to `false`) that enables the relaunch button and description to appear when multiple nodes are selected. Without `multipleSelection` set to `true` the relaunch buttons will only appear when a single node is selected. Even when `multipleSelection` is `true`, the relaunch buttons will only display if all of the selected nodes have relaunch data attached with the same `command`.

Note that if the name of a command in the manifest changes or is removed, then all buttons with that command will disappear. This behavior can be used to remove buttons when a particular action is no longer supported by the plugin.

If multiple relaunch buttons are shown for a given node or selection of nodes, the order of the buttons is determined by the order of the elements in the manifest's `relaunchButtons` array.

More formally,

```
type ManifestRelaunchButton = {  
  command: string  
  name: string  
  multipleSelection?: boolean  
}
```

---

### enableProposedApi?: boolean

See [Proposed API](/plugin-docs/proposed-api/).
**Warning: This flag is only meant for development, and will not work in published plugins!**

---

### enablePrivatePluginApi?: boolean

This enables API that's specific to private plugins.
Setting this will also enable local plugins to work with these APIs during development.

---

### build?: string

**Experimental!** A shell command to run before we load the file specified in `main` and `ui`. This can be used to call build commands such as compiling with Typescript, running Webpack, etc. The command is run in the directory of the manifest.

---

### permissions?: PluginPermissionType[]

This allows you to specify what permissions your plugin wants access to.

The possible `PluginPermissionType` are:

```
type PluginPermissionType =  
 "currentuser" |  
 "activeusers" |  
 "fileusers" |  
 "payments" |  
 "teamlibrary"
```

---

### capabilities?: ('textreview' | 'codegen' | 'inspect' | 'vscode')[]

This allows you to specify what capabilities your plugin has access to.

You can specify one or more of the following values:

Use `textreview` for [text review plugins](/plugin-docs/textreview-plugins/).

Use `codegen` for [codegen plugins](/plugin-docs/working-in-dev-mode/#plugins-for-codegen).

Use `inspect` for [inspect panel plugins](/plugin-docs/working-in-dev-mode/#plugins-for-inspection).

Use `vscode` for [Dev Mode plugins in VS Code](/plugin-docs/working-in-dev-mode/#dev-mode-plugins-in-visual-studio-code).

---

A list of code languages that your plugin supports. This is required for codegen plugins (plugins
where `editorType` is `dev`, and `capabilities` is `inspect`).

Example:

```
"codegenLanguages": [  
  { label: "Tailwind", value: "tailwind" },  
  { label: "CSS", value: "css" },  
]
```

---

Used to specify a list of preferences for your codegen plugin, such as alternative units of measure.

Example:

```
"codegenPreferences": [  
    
    
  {  
    "itemType": "unit",  
    "scaledUnit": "Rem",  
    "defaultScaleFactor": 16,  
      
    "default": true,  
  
      
    "includedLanguages": []  
  },  
  {  
    "itemType": "select",  
    "propertyName": "tabSize",  
    "label": "Tab Size",  
    "options": [  
      {"label": "2", "value": "2", isDefault: true },  
      {"label": "4", "value": "4"},  
      {"label": "8", "value": "8"}  
    ],  
      
    "includedLanguages": ["tailwind"]  
  },  
  {  
    "itemType": "action",  
    "propertyName": "showMore",  
    "label": "More settings..."  
      
    "includedLanguages": ["tailwind"],  
  },  
]
```

---

# The Typings File

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/typings/*

```
{  
  "compilerOptions": {  
    ...  
    "typeRoots": [  
      "./node_modules/@types",  
      "./node_modules/@figma"  
    ]  
  }  
}
```


---

# API Errors | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/api-errors/*

Like any software, Figma enforces that any file you create is *valid*. For example, we make sure there's no way for a user to make "Frame A" the parent of "Frame B" *and* make "Frame B" the parent of "Frame A" at the same time. We enforce these restrictions by limiting the actions that you can take. Similarly, we make sure that plugins can't create invalid content in files by throwing **errors** or **exceptions** if an operation is invalid.

A key part of building a high quality plugin is getting familiar with these restrictions. That way, your plugin won't crash if a someone uses it in a way you didn't intend.

These restrictions are documented here, as well as in the pages of various properties and functions in the **[reference](/plugin-docs/api/api-reference/)**.

Invalid Operations
------------------

Functions that take arguments and property setters always have restrictions on what kind of values you can give them. For example, `opacity` can only be set to a number, and it must also be a number between 0 and 1. So, if your plugin includes the below sample code, the following error will be returned: `Error: in set_opacity: Expected "opacity" to have type number but got string instead`.

```
figma.currentPage.selection[0].opacity = "test"
```

### General Patterns of Errors

In general, errors returned by the plugin API will follow this pattern: **Error: in <property/method>: Expected <property> to have type <expected type> but got <actual type> instead**. Please refer to the signature of each method or property you're using to know what kind of values are accepted.

Here are some additional patterns of errors and invalid operations to be aware of:

* **Writing to Node Properties:** Plugins in Dev Mode cannot edit the layers in a file (otherwise referred to as "nodes"), with the exception of certain metadata. And across other [editor types](/plugin-docs/setting-editor-type/), some nodes are read-only. Therefore, attempting to edit properties that are not editable will result in this error: `Cannot write to internal and read-only nodes`. Learn more in the [reference](/plugin-docs/api/api-reference/), as well as the [Working in Dev Mode â](/plugin-docs/working-in-dev-mode/) and [Working in FigJam â](/plugin-docs/working-in-figjam/) guides.
* **Overriding Properties on Instance Nodes:** Some properties on the [InstanceNode](/plugin-docs/api/InstanceNode/) type can be overridden, while others cannot be. For example, you can't change the order of children in an instance, or their position. Therefore, attempting to override a property that can't be overridden will result in this error: `This property cannot be overriden on an instance`. Learn more about [applying overrides to instances â](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039150733-Apply-overrides-to-instances#Supported_properties).
* **Writing to Text Properties:** Many text properties require the font of that TextNode to be loaded before they can be set. Therefore, attempting to write to text properties before the required font is loaded will result in the following error: `Cannot write to node with unloaded font "[font]"`. Learn more in the [Working with Text â](/plugin-docs/working-with-text/) guide.
* **Using properties and methods that aren't compatible with dynamic page loading:** some synchronous operations in the Plugin API aren't compatible with dynamic page loading. If a plugin has the `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"` manifest field, using these operations will trigger an error of type `Cannot call with documentAccess: dynamic-page. Use figma.getNodeByIdAsync() instead`. Learn more in the [Migrating Plugins to Dynamically Load Pages â](/plugin-docs/migrating-to-dynamic-loading/) guide.
* **Calling a method on an unloaded page:** If the plugin manifest contains the `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"` field, the plugin must explicitly load pages as needed. Using a method on a page has not been loaded will result in the following type of error: `Cannot access children on a page that has not been explicitly loaded. Remember to call` await page.loadAsync()`or`await figma.loadAllPagesAsync() `first`. Learn more in the [Migrating Plugins to Dynamically Load Pages â](/plugin-docs/migrating-to-dynamic-loading/) guide.

# Global Objects | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/global-objects/*

Tip: The [`figma`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/) global object is available in every Figma window. This means you can open the developer console in any file and access the API. This is a great way to explore the functionality of the API without having to create a plugin. You can also use this approach to test and debug your plugin code.


---

# figma | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma/*

These are methods and properties available on the `figma` global object.

General
-------

### apiVersion: '1.0.0' [readonly]

The version of the Figma API this plugin is running on, as defined in your `manifest.json` in the `"api"` field.

---

### fileKey: string | undefined [readonly]

To enable this behavior, you need to specify `enablePrivatePluginApi` in your `manifest.json`.

---

### command: string [readonly]

The currently executing command from the `manifest.json` file. It is the command string in the `ManifestMenuItem` (more details in the [manifest guide](/plugin-docs/manifest/)). If the plugin does not have any menu item, this property is undefined.

---

### pluginId?: string [readonly]

The value specified in the `manifest.json` "id" field. This only exists for Plugins.

---

Similar to `figma.pluginId` but for widgets. The value specified in the `manifest.json` "id" field. This only exists for Widgets.

When enabled, causes all node properties and methods to skip over invisible nodes (and their descendants) inside [`instances`](/plugin-docs/api/InstanceNode/).
This makes operations like document traversal much faster.

Defaults to true in Figma Dev Mode and false in Figma and FigJam

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-skipinvisibleinstancechildren/)

---

The page that the user currently viewing. You can set this value to a [`PageNode`](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/) to switch pages.

* If the manifest contains`"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, this property is read-only. Use [`figma.setCurrentPageAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#setcurrentpageasync) to update the value.

---

### setCurrentPageAsync(page: [PageNode](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/)): Promise<void>

Switch the active page to the specified [`PageNode`](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/).

---

The root of the entire Figma document. This node is used to access other pages. Each child is a [`PageNode`](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/).

---

Enables you to render UI to interact with the user, or simply to access browser APIs. This function creates a modal dialog with an `<iframe>` containing the HTML markup in the `html` argument.

Changes the position of the UI, after it has been created. Note that the position can also be set in the initial options.

---

### getPosition(): { windowSpace: [Vector](/plugin-docs/api/Vector/); canvasSpace: [Vector](/plugin-docs/api/Vector/) }

Fetches the position of the UI in window space and canvas space. Throws an error when no UI is available.

---

### close(): void

Destroys the UI and its containing `<iframe>`. Once this has been called, the code inside the iframe will be stopped and you can no longer send messages to and from it.

---

# postMessage | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-ui-postmessage/*

Sends a message to the UI's `<iframe>` window.

Signature
---------

Parameters
----------

### pluginMessage

This can be almost any data type or plain object, as long as it's a serializable object.

This is similar to saying that it should be possible to send the object over a network if it were necessary. You can send objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, Date objects and Uint8Array objects. However, functions and prototype chains of objects will not be sent.

These restrictions are the same as the browser's `postMessage`: [click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) for more details.

### options

An object that may contain the following optional parameters:

* `origin`: An advanced option, mainly used for implementing OAuth. If the `origin` option is provided, the message will only be delivered to the iframe if the origin of the document inside the iframe matches the `origin`. This defaults to `'*'`, which allows the message to be passed to any document.

# figma.util | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma-util/*

The `figma.util` global object provides a set of convenience functions for common operations.

### rgb(color: string | [RGB](/plugin-docs/api/RGB/) | [RGBA](/plugin-docs/api/RGB/#RGBA)): [RGB](/plugin-docs/api/RGB/)

Creates an `RGB` color object from a variety of common color encodings.

**Note**: since `RGB` colors are primarily used for creating `SolidPaint` objects, you might want to use [`solidPaint`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-util-solidpaint/) instead.

Accepted color formats include CSS color strings with hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()`, or `lab()` encodings, as well as `RGB` and `RGBA` objects. Alpha values in the input will be ignored. If a string encoding cannot be parsed, an error will be thrown.

Examples:

```
const color1 = figma.util.rgb('#FF00FF')  
const color2 = figma.util.rgb('hsl(25% 50% 75%)')
```

You can alias this function for more concise code:

```
const rgb = figma.util.rgb  
const color = rgb('#FF00FF')
```

### rgba(color: string | [RGB](/plugin-docs/api/RGB/) | [RGBA](/plugin-docs/api/RGB/#RGBA)): [RGBA](/plugin-docs/api/RGB/#RGBA)

Creates an `RGBA` color object from a variety of common color encodings.

Accepted color formats include CSS color strings with hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()`, or `lab()` encodings, as well as `RGB` and `RGBA` objects. Alpha defaults to 1 (opaque) if not provided in the input. If a string encoding cannot be parsed, an error will be thrown.

Examples:

```
const layoutGrid = {  
  pattern: 'GRID',  
  sectionSize: 1,  
  color: figma.util.rgba('rgb(25% 25% 25% / 0.5)')  
}

### solidPaint(color: string | [RGB](/plugin-docs/api/RGB/) | [RGBA](/plugin-docs/api/RGB/#RGBA), overrides?: Partial<[SolidPaint](/plugin-docs/api/Paint/#SolidPaint)>): [SolidPaint](/plugin-docs/api/Paint/#SolidPaint)

Creates a `SolidPaint` object, assigning color and opacity from a variety of common color encodings.

Accepted color formats include CSS color strings with hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()`, or `lab()` encodings, as well as `RGB` and `RGBA` objects. The resulting alpha value will be applied to the `SolidPaint`'s `opacity` property, which defaults to 1 (opaque) if not specified. If a string encoding cannot be parsed, an error will be thrown.

Optionally, you can provide a set of overrides for any of the non-color properties of the `SolidPaint` object. This is useful for modifying the color of an existing `SolidPaint` while preserving its other properties.

Examples:

```
figma.currentPage.backgrounds = [figma.util.solidPaint("#FF0000")]  
  
  
if (node.fills[0].type === 'SOLID') {  
  const updated = figma.util.solidPaint('#FF00FF88', node.fills[0])  
}
```

You can alias this function for more concise code:

```
const solidPaint = figma.util.solidPaint  
  
  
figma.currentPage.backgrounds = [solidPaint("#FF0000")]

  const updated = solidPaint('#FF00FF88', node.fills[0])  
}
```

### normalizeMarkdown(markdown: string): string

Normalizes the markdown string to verify what markdown will render with Figma's rich-text editors.

Examples:

```
const md = "# Hello, world!\n\nThis is a **bold** text."  
const normalizedMd = figma.util.normalizeMarkdown(md);  
  
  
component.descriptionMarkdown = normalizedMd;

# figma.codegen | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma-codegen/*

This API is only available in Figma Dev Mode

Plugins in Dev Mode can extend Figma's native [code snippets](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15023124644247#Build_faster_with_customizable_code_snippets) to generate code for languages or frameworks that Figma doesnât support, or to surface metadata that a front-end developer might find useful when implementing a design in code (e.g. where to import icons in a codebase or internationalization string extraction).

Plugins in Dev Mode specifically built for code generation ("codegen") appear in the Figma's native language dropdown. Once selected from this menu, the `figma.codegen.on("generate")` callback will get called any time the user's selection changes.

If you are building a plugin specifically for code generation, then you need to add the following to your manifest.

Add the following properties to your manifest.json

```
{  
  "editorType": ["dev"],  
  "capabilities": ["codegen"]  
}
```

These are methods and properties available on the `figma.codegen` object:

### [on](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-codegen-on/)(type: 'preferenceschange', callback: (event: [CodegenPreferencesEvent](/plugin-docs/api/CodegenPreferencesEvent/)) => Promise<void>): void

A plugin for code generation needs to call `figma.codegen.on('generate')` to register a callback
that will be called when a user's selection changes in Dev Mode. This callback
should return an array of JSON objects that represent the sections in the
Inspect panel. The callback has a 15 second timeout and returns an error if it times out. For more
information, see the remarks.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-codegen-on/)

---

### once(type: 'preferenceschange', callback: (event: [CodegenPreferencesEvent](/plugin-docs/api/CodegenPreferencesEvent/)) => Promise<void>): void

Same as [`figma.codegen.on`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-codegen-on/), but the callback only gets called the first time.

---

### off(type: 'preferenceschange', callback: (event: [CodegenPreferencesEvent](/plugin-docs/api/CodegenPreferencesEvent/)) => Promise<void>): void

Removes a callback added by [`figma.codegen.on`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-codegen-on/) or [`figma.codegen.once`](/plugin-docs/api/figma-codegen/#once).

---

Read the current preferences as specified by the user.

```
type CodegenPreferences = {  
  readonly unit: 'PIXEL' | 'SCALED'  
  readonly scaleFactor?: number  
    
    
    
  readonly customSettings: Record<string, string>  
}
```

---

### refresh: () => void

Triggers the `figma.codegen.on("generate")` callback again.

This is is useful for plugins that need to refresh the codegen output. For example, if youâre using an iframe to provide more customization options.

---

# figma.timer | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma-timer/*

This API is only available in FigJam

These are methods and properties available on the `figma.timer` global object. It represents the built-in timer that is available in FigJam. If the plugin is not running in a FigJam document, this object will not be available.

### remaining: number [readonly]

Time remaining on timer, in seconds. If the timer has not been started, returns 0.

---

### total: number [readonly]

Total time on timer, in seconds. If the timer has not been started, returns 0. The total time is defined as the time the timer was initially started at, plus or minus any time that may have been added or removed from the timer.

---

### state: 'STOPPED' | 'PAUSED' | 'RUNNING' [readonly]

The current state of the timer. If the timer is started and not paused, the state will be `"RUNNING"`. If the timer is not started or finished, the state is `"STOPPED"`. And if the timer is started but paused, the state is `"PAUSED"`.

---

### pause: () => void

Pause the timer. If the timer has not been started, does nothing.

---

### resume: () => void

Resume the timer. If the timer is not currently started and paused, does nothing.

---

### start: (seconds: number) => void

Start the timer with `seconds` seconds remaining. If the timer is not currently started, will start the timer with this total time. If the timer is currently started, will set the remaining time to this value, and increment or decrement the timer's total time based on how much time was added or removed from the remaining time. If the timer was previously paused, will also unpause the timer.

---

### stop: () => void

Stops the timer. If the timer was not started or is finished, does nothing.

# figma.viewport | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma-viewport/*

This API is only available in Figma Slides


---

# figma.clientStorage | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma-clientStorage/*

The `figma.clientStorage` API allows you to store data on the user's local machine. Unlike data stored with the document (such as [`setPluginData`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setplugindata/)), this data is not synchronized across users. It's similar to the [Window.localStorage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), but is asynchronous, and allows storing objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined and `Uint8Array`. Like `localStorage`, you should expect that user actions such as clearing the browser cache might clear all stored data.

The data is specific to your plugin ID. Plugins with other IDs won't be able to read this data.

Each plugin gets a total of 5MB of storage. You can approximate the quota used by a key/value pair by adding the size of the key to the size of the value converted to JSON. The main exception is that Uint8Array values counts as the size of the Uint8Array, rather than the array converted to JSON.

> â  The data is stored privately for **stability**, not **security**. It prevents other plugins from accessing with your data. It does not, however, prevent users from seeing data stored on their own client given sufficient effort.

> â  Data will become inaccessible if your plugin ID changes.

### getAsync(key: string): Promise<any | undefined>

Retrieves a value from client storage with the given `key`. If no value has been stored for that key, this function will asynchronously return `undefined`.

---

### setAsync(key: string, value: any): Promise<void>

Sets a value to client storage with the given `key`. The returned promise will resolve if storage is successful, or reject with an error message if storage failed.

---

### deleteAsync(key: string): Promise<void>

Removes the stored key/value pair from client storage with the given `key`. If no such key is stored, this function will return normally but will otherwise do nothing.

---

### keysAsync(): Promise<string[]>

Retrieves a list of all keys stored to client storage. Use this to enumerate the full contents of the clientStorage API.

---


---

# figma.parameters | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma-parameters/*

These are methods and properties available on the `figma.parameters` global object. See [Accepting Parameters as Input](/plugin-docs/plugin-parameters/) for more details.

```
type ParameterInputEvent<T = ParameterValues> = {  
  query: string,  
  key: string,  
  parameters: Partial<T>,  
  result: SuggestionResults,  
}
```

The `input` event is fired on every key press as the user is entering parameters for a plugin in quick actions. The expectation is that plugin will respond to these events by calling one of the APIs `result` object.

### on(type: 'input', callback: (event: [ParameterInputEvent](/plugin-docs/api/figma-parameters/#ParameterInputEvent)) => void): void

Register a handler for user input events in the quick action UI.

---

### once(type: 'input', callback: (event: [ParameterInputEvent](/plugin-docs/api/figma-parameters/#ParameterInputEvent)) => void): void

Register a handler for user input events in the quick action UI. Same as `figma.parameters.on("input")`, but only gets called the first time.

---

### off(type: 'input', callback: (event: [ParameterInputEvent](/plugin-docs/api/figma-parameters/#ParameterInputEvent)) => void): void

Removes a handler added via `figma.parameters.on`.

---

SuggestionResults
-----------------

The `result` object passed to the `'input'` event handler contains API for controlling the UI that the user sees while
entering parameter values. Most importantly it is able to provide the list of autocomplete suggestions that the user
can choose from as they type.

But the `result` object also enables showing error messages and loading states.

### setSuggestions(suggestions: Array<string | { name: string; data: any; icon: string | Uint8Array; iconUrl: string }>): void

Sets the list of autocomplete suggestions to be displayed in the quick action UI.

If you only want to provide a string suggestion, and don't need metadata or icons, you can use
an array of simple string values. For example

Simple string suggestions

```
figma.parameters.on('input', ({ query, result }) => {  
  result.setSuggestions(  
    ["Armadillo", "Baboon", "Cacatua", "Dolphin"]  
    .filter(s => s.includes(query)))  
})
```

However the API also allows providing more information with each suggestion:

* The text to display to the user
* An icon (optional)
* Hidden metadata which is passed back to the plugin if the user chooses this suggestion (optional)

Example

Suggestions with icons and data

```
result.setSuggestions([  
  { name: node1.name, data: node1.id, icon: node1Preview },  
  { name: node2.name, data: node2.id, icon: node2Preview },  
  ...  
])
```

The `name` property contains the text to display to the user in the autocomplete suggestions. This
property is required.

The `data` property allows associating hidden metadata with a given autocomplete suggestion.
This data is passed back to the plugin as the parameter's value if the user chooses this option.
If no `data` property is provided, it defaults to the value of the `name` property. I.e. the value
of the parameter will be the string that was displayed to the user.

An icon can be provided through a `icon` or `iconUrl` property. The `icon` property can contain
either a raster image in the form of a `Uint8Array`, or an SVG image in the form of a string. You
can alternatively use the `iconUrl` property to provide a URL to the image. Note that for this to
work the target server has to support CORS.

---

### setError(message: string): void

Displays an error message to the user instead of a list of autocomplete suggestions. When this function
is called, the user is prevented from moving on to the next parameter without first changing the input
for the current parameter.

This is useful to signal to the user that they have entered an invalid value and provide them
instruction for how to correct the input.

You can also use this as a way to validate pre-conditions, like current selection, or some state of the
current document. To do this, in the 'input' event handler for the first parameter key, check the that
all pre-conditions are fulfilled and call `setError` with an appropriate error message if they are not,
unconditionally of what the current `query` value is.

This function is *not* available on parameters with `allowFreeform` set. The purpose of `allowFreeform`
is to allow users to enter arbitrary values and so Figma doesn't guarantee that the plugin gets an
opportunity to handle an input event and call `setError` before the user moves on to the next parameter.

If you want to generally allow freeform input, but still retain the ability to call `setError`, you can
remove `allowFreeform` and manually add a autocomplete entry containing the current `query` string. I.e.
make the first item in the array passed to `setSuggestions` simply be the string in `query`.

For a full example of what this can look like, see the [Resizer sample plugin](https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/blob/master/resizer/code.ts)

---

### setLoadingMessage(message: string): void

Modify the default "Loading Suggestions..." message displayed until the plugin calls `setSuggestions`.
This can be useful if your plugin needs to load autocomplete messages from the network, or if you need
to perform lengthy calculations.

You can call `setLoadingMessage` multiple times in order to provide an updated message.

---

ParameterValues
---------------

```
interface ParameterValues {  
  [key: string]: any  
}
```

`ParameterValues` is the type used to pass values for parameters into plugins. It's a mapping from parameter keys, which come from the [manifest](/plugin-docs/manifest/#parameters), to the value that the user typed or chose in the autocomplete suggestions. Depending on how your plugin specified the suggestion when calling [`setSuggestions`](/plugin-docs/api/figma-parameters/#setsuggestions) the value will resolve to:

* Suggestion's `data` property if sepecified
* Suggestion's `name` property
* The suggestion itself if a string was passed as the suggestion.
* Query string for freeform parameters
* `undefined` for optional parameters that were skipped.

# figma.textreview | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma-textreview/*

These are methods and properties available on the `figma.textreview` global object. They are responsible for interacting with features relating to text review plugins. For a more information read our in depth guide on [text review plugins](/plugin-docs/textreview-plugins/).

### requestToBeEnabledAsync(): Promise<void>

This method will request your plugin to be enabled as a text review plugin for the user.
A modal will pop up that will ask the user if they want to enable the plugin for text review.
The promise returned by the function will be resolved if the user accepts in the dialog and will be rejected if the user cancels.
Note that to prevent spam the promise will be auto rejected if the user cancels the request multiple times in a given plugin run.

![Dialog box that shows when you call the function](https://static.figma.com/uploads/ee33919763431eb2520074650fddfaa904c7e9c1)

---

### requestToBeDisabledAsync(): Promise<void>

This method will disable the plugin as a text review plugin if it is enabled. The promise will resolve if it has been successfully been disabled and reject if it wasnât enabled in the first place.

---

### isEnabled: boolean [readonly]

This property is a readonly boolean that can be used to check if your plugin is enabled as a text review plugin for the user. It will be true if the plugin is enabled, and false if the plugin is disabled.

# figma.payments | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma-payments/*

These are all defined on `figma.payments`.

`payments` must be specified in the permissions array in `manifest.json` to access this property.

```
{  
  "permissions": ["payments"]  
}
```

If your manifest doesn't contain these fields, the payments API methods described below will throw errors if you try to use them.

An object describing the userâs payment status. Right now, the only
attribute on this object is whether the user has paid. In the future, we
might add more attributes here to provide more information.

```
type PaymentStatus = {  
  type: "UNPAID" | "PAID" | "NOT_SUPPORTED"  
}
```

A status type of `NOT_SUPPORTED` indicates that an internal error has occurred
and the user's payment status could not be determined at that time. Plugins
should treat `NOT_SUPPORTED` as an error and not grant access to paid features.

In development, youâll be able to test out the entire checkout flow without
having to input any actual payment information. Doing so will update your
payment status accordingly. Any changes to payment status in development is
local and not persisted, and will be reset when restarting your client or
using a different machine.

For published resources, this always returns `PAID` for the creator.

---

### setPaymentStatusInDevelopment(status: [PaymentStatus](/plugin-docs/api/figma-payments/#PaymentStatus)): void

This method can only be used in development.

This sets your payment status to the value of the `status` argument in this
method. This is a global setting that will impact your payment status for
all plugins or widgets you run in development.

---

### getUserFirstRanSecondsAgo(): number

When the plugin was first run by the current user.

This is defined as the number of seconds since the current user ran the
plugin or widget for the first time. This will return 0 the very first time
a user runs your plugin, and will always return 0 when running a plugin in
development.

---

### initiateCheckoutAsync(options?: { interstitial: 'PAID\_FEATURE' | 'TRIAL\_ENDED' | 'SKIP' }): Promise<void>

This triggers a checkout flow in the Figma UI for the user to purchase your
plugin or widget. The user will be prompted to enter their payment
information and purchase your resource. This function resolves either when
the user has completed the checkout flow, or theyâve dismissed it.

This function will throw an exception in certain cases:

1. While in query mode and accepting plugin parameters.
2. During widget rendering. Instead, put calls to this function inside your widget event handlers.

See [our guide](/plugin-docs/requiring-payment/#when-to-call-initiatecheckoutasync) for more information.

This function takes an `options` argument that controls the behavior of the
checkout flow.

```
type CheckoutOptions = {  
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  interstitial?: "PAID_FEATURE" | "TRIAL_ENDED" | "SKIP"  
}
```

After `initiateCheckoutAsync` resolves, use `figma.payments.status` to check
the userâs payment status.

---

### requestCheckout(): void

This is useful for [text review plugins](/plugin-docs/textreview-plugins/). Since these
plugins can only run in query mode, they cannot call
`initiateCheckoutAsync` while a user is editing text as that will throw an
exception.

if you are building a text review plugin, call `requestCheckout` to
indicate that the user needs to checkout in order to continue using the
plugin. When the user exits text editing, they will be prompted to
checkout. If the user dismisses the checkout flow, the text review plugin
will automatically be disabled.

---

### getPluginPaymentTokenAsync(): Promise<string>

This method generates a token that can be used to securely communicate the
identity of the current user on the current plugin or widget. You can
provide its returned value as the `plugin_payment_token` query parameter to
the [payments REST API](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#payments) endpoint.

Code Examples
-------------

**Limiting free usage of the entire plugin to a number of days**

```
const ONE_DAY_IN_SECONDS = 60 * 60 * 24;  
const secondsSinceFirstRun = figma.payments.getUserFirstRanSecondsAgo()  
const daysSinceFirstRun = secondsSinceFirstRun / ONE_DAY_IN_SECONDS  
  
async function checkAndRunPluginFeatureCode() {  
  if (figma.payments.status.type === "UNPAID" && daysSinceFirstRun > 3) {  
    await figma.payments.initiateCheckoutAsync({  
      interstitial: "TRIAL_ENDED"  
    })  
    if (figma.payments.status.type === "UNPAID") {  
      figma.notify("Your free trial has expired, please upgrade to continue.")  
      return  
    }  
  }  
  
    
}
```

# skipInvisibleInstanceChildren | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-skipinvisibleinstancechildren/*

skipInvisibleInstanceChildren
=============================

When enabled, causes all node properties and methods to skip over invisible nodes (and their descendants) inside [`instances`](/plugin-docs/api/InstanceNode/).
This makes operations like document traversal much faster.

Defaults to true in Figma Dev Mode and false in Figma and FigJam

Signature
---------

Accessing and modifying invisible nodes and their descendants inside instances can be slow with the plugin API.
This is especially true in large documents with tens of thousands of nodes where a call to [`findAll`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-findall/) might come across many of these invisible instance children.

If your plugin does not need access to these nodes, we recommend setting `figma.skipInvisibleInstanceChildren = true` as that often makes document traversal significantly faster.

When this flag is enabled, it will not be possible to access invisible nodes (and their descendants) inside instances. This has the following effects:

For example, suppose that a portion of the document tree looks like this:

Frame (visible) â Instance (visible) â Frame (invisible) â Text (visible)

The last two frame and text nodes cannot be accessed after setting `figma.skipInvisibleInstanceChildren = true`.

The benefit of enabling this flag is that document traversal methods, [`findAll`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-findall/) and [`findOne`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-findone/), can be up to several times faster in large documents that have invisible instance children.
[`findAllWithCriteria`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-findallwithcriteria/) can be up to hundreds of times faster in large documents.

# closePlugin | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-closeplugin/*

Closes the plugin. You should always call this function once your plugin is done running. When called, any UI that's open will be closed and any `setTimeout` or `setInterval` timers will be cancelled.

Signature
---------

### [closePlugin](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-closeplugin/)(message?: string): void

Parameters
----------

### message

Optional -- display a visual bell toast with the message after the plugin closes.

Calling `figma.closePlugin()` disables callbacks and Figma APIs. It does not, however, abort the plugin. Any lines of Javascript after this call will also run. For example, consider the following plugin that expects the user to have one layer selected:

Simple closePlugin

```
if (figma.currentPage.selection.length !== 1) {  
  figma.closePlugin()  
}  
figma.currentPage.selection[0].opacity = 0.5
```

This will not work. The last line will still run, but will throw an exception because access to `figma.currentPage` has been disabled. As such, it is not recommended to run any code after calling `figma.closePlugin()`.

A simple way to easily exit your plugin is to wrap your plugin in a function, instead of running code at the top-level, and always follow `figma.closePlugin()` with a `return` statement:

Early return

```
function main() {  
  if (figma.currentPage.selection.length !== 1) {  
    figma.closePlugin()  
    return  
  }  
  figma.currentPage.selection[0].opacity = 0.5  
}  
main()
```

It's good practice to have all input validation done at the start of the plugin. However, there may be cases where the plugin may need to close after a chain of multiple function calls. If you expect to have to close the plugin deep within your code, but don't want to necessarily want the user to see an error, the example above will not be sufficient.

One alternative is to use a top-level try-catch statement. However, you will need to be responsible for making sure that there are no usages of try-catch between the top-level try-catch and the call to `figma.closePlugin()`, or to pass along the close command if necessary. Example:

Top-level try-catch

```
const CLOSE_PLUGIN_MSG = "_CLOSE_PLUGIN_"  
function someNestedFunctionCallThatClosesThePlugin() {  
  throw CLOSE_PLUGIN_MSG  
}  
  
function main() {  
  someNestedFunctionCallThatClosesThePlugin()  
}  
  
try {  
  main()  
} catch (e) {  
  if (e === CLOSE_PLUGIN_MSG) {  
    figma.closePlugin()  
  } else {  
      
      
      
    throw e  
  }  
}
```

# on | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-on/*

Registers an callback that will be called when an event happens in the editor. Current supported events are:

* The selection on the current page changed.
* The current page changed.
* The document has changed.
* An object from outside Figma is dropped onto the canvas
* The plugin has started running.
* The plugin closed.
* The plugin has started running.
* The timer has started running.
* The timer has paused.
* The timer has stopped.
* The timer is done.
* The timer has resumed.

Signature
---------

### [on](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: 'run', callback: (event: [RunEvent](/plugin-docs/api/RunEvent/)) => void): void

### [on](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: 'drop', callback: (event: [DropEvent](/plugin-docs/api/DropEvent/)) => boolean): void

### [on](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: 'documentchange', callback: (event: [DocumentChangeEvent](/plugin-docs/api/DocumentChangeEvent/)) => void): void

### [on](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: 'slidesviewchange', callback: (event: [SlidesViewChangeEvent](/plugin-docs/api/SlidesViewChangeEvent/)) => void): void

### [on](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-on/)(type: 'stylechange', callback: (event: [StyleChangeEvent](/plugin-docs/api/StyleChangeEvent/)) => void): void

Parameters
----------

### type

A string identifying the type of event that the callback will be called on.

This is either an `ArgFreeEventType`, `run`, `drop`, or `documentchange`. The `run` event callback will be passed a `RunEvent`. The `drop` event callback will be passed a `DropEvent`. The `documentchange` event callback will be passed a `DocumentChangeEvent`.

```
type ArgFreeEventType =  
  "selectionchange" |  
  "currentpagechange" |  
  "close" |  
  "timerstart" |  
  "timerstop" |  
  "timerpause" |  
  "timerresume" |  
  "timeradjust" |  
  "timerdone"
```

### callback

A function that will be called when the event happens.
If `type` is 'run', then this function will be passed a `RunEvent`.
If `type` is 'drop', then this function will be passed a `DropEvent`.
If `type` is 'documentchange', then this function will be passed a `DocumentChangeEvent`.

Otherwise nothing will be passed in.

This API tries to match Node.js conventions around similar `.on` APIs.

It's important to understand that the `.on` API runs the callbacks **asynchronously**. For example:

```
figma.on("selectionchange", () => { console.log("changed") })  
console.log("before")  
figma.currentPage.selection = []  
console.log("after")
```

The asynchronous nature of these APIs have a few other implications.

The callback will not necessarily be called each time the event happens. For example, this will only trigger the event once:

```
figma.currentPage.selection = [figma.createRectangle()]  
figma.currentPage.selection = [figma.createFrame()]
```

Nor will the ordering of the event trigger and event registration affect whether the callback is called.

```
figma.currentPage.selection = [figma.createFrame()]  
figma.on("selectionchange", () => { "this will get called!" })
```

Available event types
---------------------

### `"currentpagechange"`

This event will trigger when the user navigates to a different page, or when the plugin changes the value of `figma.currentPage`.

### `"selectionchange"`

This event will trigger when the selection of the **current page** changes. This can happen:

* By user action.
* Due to plugin code.
* When the current page changes (a `"currentpagechange"` event always triggers a `"selectionchange"` event).
* When a selected node is deleted.
* When a selected node becomes the child of another selected node (in which case it is considered indirectly selected, and is no longer in `figma.currentPage.selection`)

Note also that changing the selection via the plugin API, then changing it back to its previous value immediately still triggers the event.

### `"documentchange"`

If the plugin manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, you must first call [`figma.loadAllPagesAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#loadallpagesasync) to access this event. Because this may introduce a loading delay, consider using more granular alternatives, such as the `"stylechange"` event, or using [`PageNode.on`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/PageNode-on/) with the `"nodechange"` event.

This event will trigger when a change is made to the currently open file. The event will be called when nodes/styles are either added, removed, or changed in a document.

The callback will be passed with a DocumentChangeEvent with the below interface:

```
interface DocumentChangeEvent {  
  documentChanges: DocumentChange[]  
}
```

Note that `DocumentChangeEvent` has a `documentChanges` property with an array of `DocumentChange`s. Figma will not call the 'documentchange' callback synchronously and will instead batch the updates and send them to the callback periodically.

There are 6 different [`DocumentChange`](/plugin-docs/api/DocumentChange/) types that we currently notify on and we might add more in the future. Each of these changes has a `type` property to distinguish them:

| Change | `type` property | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`CreateChange`](/plugin-docs/api/DocumentChange/#createchange) | `'CREATE'` | A node has been created in the document. If a node with nested children is being added to the document a `CreateChange` will only be made for the highest level parent that was added to the document. |
| [`DeleteChange`](/plugin-docs/api/DocumentChange/#deletechange) | `'DELETE'` | A node has been removed from the document. If a node with nested children is being removed from the document a `DeleteChange` will only be made for the highest level parent that was removed from the document. |
| [`PropertyChange`](/plugin-docs/api/DocumentChange/#propertychange) | `'PROPERTY_CHANGE'` | A property of a node has changed. |
| [`StyleCreateChange`](/plugin-docs/api/DocumentChange/#stylecreatechange) | `'STYLE_CREATE'` | A style has been added to the document. |
| [`StyleDeleteChange`](/plugin-docs/api/DocumentChange/#styledeletechange) | `'STYLE_DELETE'` | A style has been removed from the document. |
| [`StylePropertyChange`](/plugin-docs/api/DocumentChange/#stylepropertychange) | `'STYLE_PROPERTY_CHANGE'` | A style has had a property changed. |

#### Special cases

We currently never notify a `'documentchange'` listener in the following scenarios:

* if the change was caused directly by your plugin in a `documentchange` callback
* if an instance sublayer was updated by a change to a main component
* if a node was updated as a result of a style changing

#### Example

Here is an example of exhaustively checking changes to the document and logging them to the console.

```
figma.on("documentchange", (event) => {  
for (const change of event.documentChanges) {  
  switch (change.type) {  
    case "CREATE":  
      console.log(  
        `Node ${change.id} created by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`  
      );  
      break;  
  
    case "DELETE":  
      console.log(  
        `Node ${change.id} deleted by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`  
      );  
      break;  
  
    case "PROPERTY_CHANGE":  
      for (const prop of change.properties) {  
        console.log(  
          `Node ${  
            change.id  
          } had ${prop} changed by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`  
        );  
      }  
      break;  
  
    case "STYLE_CREATE":  
      console.log(  
        `Style ${change.id} created by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`  
      );  
      break;  
  
    case "STYLE_DELETE":  
      console.log(  
        `Style ${change.id} deleted by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`  
      );  
      break;  
  
     case "STYLE_PROPERTY_CHANGE":  
       for (const prop of change.properties) {  
         console.log(  
            `Style ${  
              change.id  
            } had ${prop} changed by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`  
          );  
       }  
       break;  
    }  
  }  
});
```

For a more involved example see our [plugin samples on GitHub](https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/tree/master/document-change).

### `"textreview"`

This event is only available to plugins that have the `"textreview"` capability in their `manifest.json` and the plugin is running in text review mode.

`"textreview"` events allow plugins to review text in a document and act as either a replacement or a supplement to native spell check.

This event is triggered periodically when the user is typing in a text node. The callback will be passed with a TextReviewEvent with the below interface:

```
interface TextReviewEvent {  
  text: string  
}
```

The `text` property is the text that the user has currently typed into the node.

A `"textreview"` event listener should return a promise that resolves to an array of `TextReviewRange` objects. Each `TextReviewRange` object represents a single range of text that should be marked as either an error or a suggestion. The `TextReviewRange` interface is defined as:

```
type TextReviewRange = {  
  start: number  
  end: number  
  suggestions: string[]  
  color?: 'RED' | 'GREEN' | 'BLUE'  
}
```

The `start` property is the index of the first character in the range. The `end` property is the index of the last character in the range. The `suggestions` property is an array of strings that represent the suggestions for the range. The `color` property is optional and can be used to change the color of the underline that is drawn under the range. If no color is specified the underline will be red.

For more information read our in depth guide on [text review plugins](/plugin-docs/textreview-plugins/).

### `"drop"`

This event will trigger when objects outside Figma (such as elements from other browser windows, or files from the local filesystem) are dropped onto the canvas.

It can also be triggered by a special `pluginDrop` message sent from the UI. See the [Triggering drop events from the UI](/plugin-docs/creating-ui/#triggering-drop-events-from-the-ui) section for more details.

The callback will be passed a `DropEvent` with the below interface. It should return `false` if it wants to handle the particular drop and stop Figma from performing the default drop behavior.

```
interface DropEvent {  
  node: BaseNode | SceneNode  
  x: number  
  y: number  
  absoluteX: number  
  absoluteY: number  
  items: DropItem[]  
  files: DropFile[]  
  dropMetadata?: any  
}
```

* The `node` property contains the node where the drop landed. This will sometimes be the page node if the drop didn't land on anything in the canvas, or if target node is locked or cannot be a parent of another node.
* The `x` and `y` properties are coordinates relative to the node drop target
* The `absoluteX` and `absoluteY` properties are absolute canvas coordinates
* The `items` property is an array of `DropItem` objects. You will see multiple objects if a drop contains multiple, non-file data types. If there are no data items, this array will be empty.
* The `files` property is an array of dropped files represented as `DropFile` objects. If no files are present, this array will be empty.
* The `dropMetadata` property comes from drop events [explicitly triggered by the UI](/plugin-docs/creating-ui/#triggering-drop-events-from-the-ui).

Items and files will conform to the below interfaces:

```
interface DropItem {  
  type: string   
  data: string  
}  
  
interface DropFile {  
  name: string   
  type: string   
  getBytesAsync(): Promise<Uint8Array>   
  getTextAsync(): Promise<string>   
}
```

See the Icon Drag-and-Drop and PNG Crop examples in the [figma/plugin-samples](https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples) repository for plugins that implement this API.

#### UI Recommendations

When the plugin registers a drop callback, it should give the user instructions with either text in the plugin UI or [`figma.notify()`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-notify/) (if the plugin does not show a UI) telling them what to do.

[`figma.notify()`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-notify/) can be called with the `timeout` option set to `Infinity` to make the notification show for as long as the plugin is open.

### `"close"`

This event will trigger when the plugin is about to close, either from a call to `figma.closePlugin()` or the user closing the plugin via the UI.

This is a good place to run cleanup actions. For example, some plugins add UI elements in the canvas by creating nodes. These UI elements should be deleted when the plugin is closed. Note that you don't need to call `figma.closePlugin()` again in this function.

**You should use this API only if strictly necessary, and run as little code as possible in the callback when doing so**. When a user closes a plugin, they expect it to be closed immediately. Having long-running actions in the closing callback prevents the plugin for closing promptly.

This is also not the place to run any asynchronous actions (e.g. register callbacks, using `await`, etc). The plugin execution environment will be destroyed immediately when all the callbacks have returned, and further callbacks will not be called.

### `"run"`

This event is triggered when a plugin is run. For plugins with parameters, this happens after all parameters have been enter by the user in the quick action UI. For all other plugins this happens immediately after launch.

The callback will be passed a `RunEvent` that looks like:

```
interface RunEvent {  
  parameters?: ParameterValues  
  command: string  
}
```

* The `parameters` property is of type [`ParameterValues`](/plugin-docs/api/figma-parameters/#parametervalues), and contains the value entered for each parameter.
* The `command` argument is the same as [`figma.command`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#command), but provided here again for convenience.

Handling the `run` event is only required for plugins with parameters. For all plugins it can still be a convenient spot to put your top level code, since it is called
on every plugin run.

### `"stylechange"`

Triggered when any styles in the document change.

The callback will receive a StyleChangeEvent with the below interface:

```
interface StyleChangeEvent {  
  styleChanges: StyleChange[]  
}
```

There are 3 different [`StyleChange`](/plugin-docs/api/StyleChange/) types. Each of these changes has a `type` property to distinguish them:

### `"timerstart"`

This event will trigger when somebody starts a timer in the document. This can happen either by a user (either the current user or a multiplayer user) starting the timer from the UI, or triggered by plugin code. To inspect the current state of the timer when this event fires, use the `figma.timer` interface. For example:

```
figma.on("timerstart", () => console.log(figma.timer.remaining))  
figma.timer.start(300)
```

### `"timerpause"`

Triggered when a timer that is running is paused.

### `"timerstop"`

Triggered when the timer is stopped.

### `"timerdone"`

Triggered when the timer is running and reaches 0 time remaining.

### `"timerresume"`

Triggered when a timer that is paused is resumed.

### `"timeradjust"`

Triggered when the total time on the timer changes. From the UI, it is only possible to add time to the timer. However, plugin code can both add and remove time from a running timer.

Creates a new page divider, appended to the document's list of children. A page divider is a [`PageNode`](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/) with `isPageDivider` true.

Signature
---------

Parameters
----------

### dividerName

An optional argument to specify the name of the page divider node. It won't change how the page divider appears in the UI, but it specifies the name of the underlying node. The dividerName must be a page divider name (all asterisks, all en dashes, all em dashes, or all spaces). If no dividerName is specified, the default name for the created page divider node is "---".

A page divider is always the child of the document node and cannot have any children.

# loadFontAsync | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-loadfontasync/*

Makes a font available *in the plugin* for use when creating and modifying text. Calling this function is **necessary** to modify any property of a text node that may cause the rendered text to change, including `.characters`, `.fontSize`, `.fontName`, etc.

You can either pass in a hardcoded font, a font loaded via `listAvailableFontsAsync`, or the font stored on an existing text node.

Read more about how to work with fonts, when to load them, and how to load them in the [Working with Text](/plugin-docs/working-with-text/) page.

Signature
---------

This function only works to load fonts *already accessible in the Figma editor* available to *plugins*. It does not load fonts from the internet.

Tip: to load multiple fonts at the same time, you may find [Promise.all](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all) helpful.

A common question is whether a plugin needs to be careful about calling `loadFontAsync(font)` for the same font multiple times. The answer is somewhat nuanced. The result of loading a font is cached, so calling `loadFontAsync` won't re-fetch the same font from disk. Therefore, calling `loadFontAsync` on every frame would be perfectly ok.

However, note that `loadFontAsync` returns a Promise. Even a Promise resolves immediately, it still needs to round-trip to the JavaScript event loop. So you probably shouldn't call `loadFontAsync` on the same font repeatedly inside a loop.


---

# createImage | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createimage/*

Creates an `Image` object from the raw bytes of a file content. Note that `Image` objects **are not nodes**. They are handles to images stored by Figma. Frame backgrounds, or fills of shapes (e.g. a rectangle) may contain images.
[Example: how to work with images](/plugin-docs/working-with-images/).

Signature
---------

The `data` passed in must be encoded as a PNG, JPEG, or GIF. Images have a maximum size of 4096 pixels (4K) in width and height. Invalid images will throw an error.

Possible error cases
--------------------

`Image is too small`

`Image is too large`

`Image type is unsupported`


---

# createImageAsync | Plugin API

# createVideoAsync | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createvideoasync/*

Creates a `Video` object from the raw bytes of a file content. Like `Image` objects, `Video` objects **are not nodes**. They are handles to images stored by Figma. Frame backgrounds, or fills of shapes (e.g. a rectangle) may contain videos.

Signature
---------

The `data` passed in must be encoded as a .MP4, .MOV, or .WebM. Videos have a maximum size of 100MB. Invalid videos will throw an error.

Video can only be added to files in a paid Education, Professional, and Organization team. Plugins running on files in free Starter teams can edit existing video in a file but not upload video to it.

Possible error cases
--------------------

`Uploading videos only works in files in paid Pro teams`

`Video file type must be MP4`

`Video file must be less than 100MB`

# combineAsVariants | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-combineasvariants/*

This API is only available in Figma Design

Creates a new [`ComponentSetNode`](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentSetNode/) by combining all the nodes in `nodes`, which should all have type [`ComponentNode`](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentNode/).

Signature
---------

Parameters
----------

### nodes

The list of nodes in the new component set. This list must be non-empty, and must consist of only component nodes.

### parent

The node under which the new component set will be created. This is similar to `parent.appendChild(componentSet)`, but must be specified at the time that the group is created rather than later.

### index

An optional index argument that specifies where inside `parent` the new component set will be created. When this argument is not provided, it will default to appending the component set as the last (topmost) child. This is similar to the index argument in `parent.insertChild(index, componentSet)`.

This API is roughly the equivalent of pressing the "Combine as Variants" button in the editor, but combines the specified list of nodes rather than the current selection. You may still, of course, combine the current selection as variants by passing it as an argument:

Combining variants

```
figma.combineAsVariants(figma.currentPage.selection, parent)
```

Why is there no `figma.createComponentSet()` function? It would create an empty component set, and empty component sets are not supported in Figma.

Since combining as variants involves moving nodes to a different parent, this operation is subject to many reparenting restrictions:

Possible error cases
--------------------

`First argument must be an array of at least one node`

`Cannot insert node at index greater than the number of existing siblings`

`Grouped nodes must be in the same page as the parent`

`Cannot move node. Node is the scene root, which cannot be reparented`

`Cannot move node. Doing so would create a parenting cycle`

`Cannot move node. The root node cannot have children of type other than PAGE`

`Cannot move node. Nodes other than the root node cannot have children of type PAGE`

`Cannot move node. New parent is of a type that cannot have children`

`Cannot move node. New parent is a internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. Node is an internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. New parent is an instance or is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Node is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component cycle`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component inside a component`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component set cycle`

`Cannot move node. A COMPONENT_SET node cannot have children of type other than COMPONENT`

`Cannot move node. PageDivider cannot have children`


---

# group | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-group/*

Creates new group containing all the nodes in `nodes`. There is no `createGroup` function -- use this instead. Group nodes have many quirks, like auto-resizing, that you can read about in the [`FrameNode`](/plugin-docs/api/FrameNode/) section.

Signature
---------

Parameters
----------

### nodes

The list of nodes in the new group. This list must be non-empty as Figma does not support empty groups. This list cannot include any node that cannot be reparented, such as children of instances.

### parent

The node under which the new group will be created. This is similar to `parent.appendChild(group)`, but must be specified at the time that the group is created rather than later.

### index

An optional index argument that specifies where inside `parent` the new group will be created. When this argument is not provided, it will default to appending the group as the last (topmost) child. This is similar to the index argument in `parent.insertChild(index, group)`.

This API is roughly the equivalent of pressing Ctrl-G/âG in the editor, but groups the specified list of nodes rather than the current selection. You may still, of course, group the current selection by passing it as an argument:

Group nodes

```
figma.group(figma.currentPage.selection, parent)
```

Why is there no `figma.createGroup()` function? It would create an empty group, and empty groups are not supported in Figma.

Why do we require `figma.group(...)` to specify the parent, rather let you call `parent.appendChild(group)` separately? It allows you to create the new group while keeping all the grouped layers in the same absolute x/y locations. The method `.appendChild` preserves the *relative* position of a node, so if you use `.appendChild` to populate a group, you would need to do additional work to put them back in their original location if that was the desired behavior.

Since grouping involves moving nodes to a different parent, this operation is subject to many reparenting restrictions:

Possible error cases
--------------------

`First argument must be an array of at least one node`

`Cannot insert node at index greater than the number of existing siblings`

`Grouped nodes must be in the same page as the parent`

`Cannot move node. Node is the scene root, which cannot be reparented`

`Cannot move node. Doing so would create a parenting cycle`

`Cannot move node. The root node cannot have children of type other than PAGE`

`Cannot move node. Nodes other than the root node cannot have children of type PAGE`

`Cannot move node. New parent is of a type that cannot have children`

`Cannot move node. New parent is a internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. Node is an internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. New parent is an instance or is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Node is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component cycle`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component inside a component`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component set cycle`

`Cannot move node. A COMPONENT_SET node cannot have children of type other than COMPONENT`

`Cannot move node. PageDivider cannot have children`

# flatten | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-flatten/*

Flattens every node in nodes into a new vector network.

Signature
---------

Parameters
----------

### nodes

The list of nodes in the new group. This list must be non-empty and cannot include any node that cannot be reparented, such as children of instances. Make a copy of those nodes first if necessary.

### parent

The node under which the new vector will be created. This is similar to `parent.appendChild(group)` and defaults to `figma.currentPage` if left unspecified.

### index

An optional index argument that specifies where inside `parent` the new vector will be created. When this argument is not provided, it will default to appending the vector as the last (topmost) child. This is similar to the index argument in `parent.insertChild(index, group)`.

This API is roughly the equivalent of pressing Ctrl-E/âE in the editor, but flattens the specified list of nodes rather than the current selection. You may still, of course, flatten the current selection by passing it as an argument:

Flatten nodes

```
figma.flatten(figma.currentPage.selection, parent)
```

Since flattening involves moving nodes to a different parent, this operation is subject to many reparenting restrictions:

Possible error cases
--------------------

`First argument must be an array of at least one node`

`Cannot insert node at index greater than the number of existing siblings`

`Grouped nodes must be in the same page as the parent`

`Cannot move node. Node is the scene root, which cannot be reparented`

`Cannot move node. Doing so would create a parenting cycle`

`Cannot move node. The root node cannot have children of type other than PAGE`

`Cannot move node. New parent is of a type that cannot have children`

`Cannot move node. New parent is a internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. Node is an internal, readonly-only node`

`Cannot move node. New parent is an instance or is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Node is inside of an instance`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component cycle`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component inside a component`

`Cannot move node. Reparenting would create a component set cycle`

`Cannot move node. A COMPONENT_SET node cannot have children of type other than COMPONENT`

`Cannot move node. PageDivider cannot have children`

# ungroup | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-ungroup/*

Ungroups the given `node`, moving all of `node`'s children into `node`'s parent and removing `node`. Returns an array of nodes that were children of `node`.

Signature
---------

Parameters
----------

### node

The node to ungroup.

This API is roughly the equivalent of pressing Ctrl-Shift-G/ââ§G in the editor, but ungroups the given node rather than all nodes in the current selection.

If the ungrouped node is part of the current selection, the ungrouped node's children will become part of the selection. Otherwise the selection is unchanged.

Possible error cases
--------------------

`Instances cannot be ungrouped`

`Components cannot be ungrouped`

`Only group-like nodes can be ungrouped`

`The given node cannot be ungrouped`

# BooleanOperationNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/BooleanOperationNode/*

Boolean operations combine any set of shape layers through one of four formulas: Union, Subtract, Intersect, and Exclude. The layers to be combined are stored in its `children` array. You can create boolean operation nodes using [`figma.union`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#union), [`figma.subtract`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#subtract), [`figma.intersect`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#intersect), [`figma.exclude`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#exclude).

Like the group node, the boolean operations node is always set to fit its children. As such, its position and size can change when you add or resize its children.

More information on how boolean operations work can be found on our [help page](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957534).

Boolean operation properties
----------------------------

### type: 'BOOLEAN\_OPERATION' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "BOOLEAN\_OPERATION"

---

Duplicates the boolean operation node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

### booleanOperation: 'UNION' | 'INTERSECT' | 'SUBTRACT' | 'EXCLUDE'

The type of operation used to combine the children of this node.

---

### expanded: boolean

Whether this container is shown as expanded in the layers panel.

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

The name of the layer that appears in the layers panel. Calling `figma.root.name` will return the name, read-only, of the current file.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Removes this node and **all of its children** from the document.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-remove/)

---

### [setRelaunchData](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)(data: { [command: string]: string }): void

Sets state on the node to show a button and description when the node is selected. Clears the button and description when `relaunchData` is `{}`.

In Figma and Dev Mode, this shows up in the properties panel. In FigJam, this shows up in the property menu. See [here](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/#example-figma-design-ui) for examples.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

---

### getRelaunchData(): { [command: string]: string }

Retreives the reluanch data stored on this node using [`setRelaunchData`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

---

### isAsset: boolean [readonly]

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

---

### getTopLevelFrame(): [FrameNode](/plugin-docs/api/FrameNode/) | undefined

Returns the top-most frame that contains this node. If the node is not inside a frame, this will return undefined.

This function will only work in Figma Design and will throw an error if called in FigJam or Slides.

---

# ComponentNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/ComponentNode/*

Components are UI elements that can be reused across your designs. They are like frames, with the additional ability to have auto-updating copies called instances (see [`InstanceNode`](/plugin-docs/api/InstanceNode/)).

The file may already contain instances of this frame, or you might create them via [`createInstance`](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentNode/#createinstance). When you set a property on a component (or change its content), all instances of that component will update.

Be aware that some component nodes reflect components in the team library that are used within this file. Those components are read-only, though you may create new instances of them.

Component properties
--------------------

### type: 'COMPONENT' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "COMPONENT"

---

Duplicates the component node as a **new** component with no instances of it. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

Creates an instance of this component. By default, the instance will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

### getInstancesAsync(): Promise<[InstanceNode](/plugin-docs/api/InstanceNode/)[]>

Returns an array of all of the instances of this component in the document.

---

**DEPRECATED:** Use [`getInstancesAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentNode/#getinstancesasync) instead. Accessing this property will throw an exception if the plugin manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`.

Returns an array of all of the instances of this component in the document.

# ComponentSetNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/ComponentSetNode/*

A component set contains the variants of a component. It behaves much like a normal frame would, but all of its children are [`ComponentNode`](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentNode/)s.

Be aware that some component sets reflect items in the team library that are used within this file. Those component sets and their children are read-only, though you may create new instances of the [`ComponentNode`](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentNode/)s that are inside them.

In Figma, component sets must always have children. A component set with no children will delete itself.

Component set properties
------------------------

### type: 'COMPONENT\_SET' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "COMPONENT\_SET"

---

Duplicates the component set as a new component set. Its children will be duplicated as **new** components with no instances of them. By default, the duplicate will be parented under figma.currentPage.

---

### defaultVariant: [ComponentNode](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentNode/) [readonly]

The default variant of this component set, which is the top-left-most variant, spatially. This corresponds to the variant that would be inserted when dragging in a component set from the team library in the Figma UI.

---

### variantGroupProperties: { [property: string]: { values: string[] } } [readonly]

**DEPRECATED:** Use `componentPropertyDefinitions` instead.

---

Publishable properties
----------------------

The plain-text annotation entered by the user for this style/component.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-documentationlinks/)

---

### remote: boolean [readonly]

Whether this style/component is a remote style/component that doesn't live in the file (i.e. is from the team library). Remote components are read-only: attempts to change their properties will throw.

---

### key: string [readonly]

The key to use with [`figma.importComponentByKeyAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#importcomponentbykeyasync), [`figma.importComponentSetByKeyAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#importcomponentsetbykeyasync) and [`figma.importStyleByKeyAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#importstylebykeyasync). Note that while this key is present on local and published components, you can only import components that are already published.

---

### getPublishStatusAsync(): Promise<[PublishStatus](/plugin-docs/api/PublishStatus/)>

Gets the status of this style/component in the team library.

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

The name of the layer that appears in the layers panel. Calling `figma.root.name` will return the name, read-only, of the current file.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Removes this node and **all of its children** from the document.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-remove/)

---

### [setRelaunchData](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)(data: { [command: string]: string }): void

Sets state on the node to show a button and description when the node is selected. Clears the button and description when `relaunchData` is `{}`.

In Figma and Dev Mode, this shows up in the properties panel. In FigJam, this shows up in the property menu. See [here](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/#example-figma-design-ui) for examples.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

Retreives the reluanch data stored on this node using [`setRelaunchData`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

---

### isAsset: boolean [readonly]

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

---

### getTopLevelFrame(): [FrameNode](/plugin-docs/api/FrameNode/) | undefined

Returns the top-most frame that contains this node. If the node is not inside a frame, this will return undefined.

This function will only work in Figma Design and will throw an error if called in FigJam or Slides.

---

You can set individual corner radius of each of the four corners of a rectangle node or frame-like node. Similar to `cornerRadius`, these value must be non-negative and can be fractional. If an edge length is less than twice the corner radius, the corner radius for each vertex of the edge will be clamped to half the edge length.

Setting `cornerRadius` sets the property for all four corners. Setting these corners to different values makes `cornerRadius` return `mixed`.

You can set individual stroke weights for each of the four sides of a rectangle node or frame-like node. Similar to [strokeWeight](/plugin-docs/api/node-properties/#strokeweight), these values must be non-negative and can be fractional. To hide a side, set the value to 0.

# DocumentNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/DocumentNode/*

The document node is the root node. There can only be one document node per browser tab, and each of its children must be a [`PageNode`](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/).

Most plugins will not need to use this node unless they are creating new pages or performing a document-wide operation. In the latter case, it's recommended to only read and not write, as the user may not see the modifications made on a different page.

Document properties
-------------------

### type: 'DOCUMENT' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "DOCUMENT"

---

### children: ReadonlyArray<[PageNode](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/)> [readonly]

The list of children. For `DocumentNode`s, children are always [`PageNode`](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/)s.

---

### documentColorProfile: 'LEGACY' | 'SRGB' | 'DISPLAY\_P3' [readonly]

The color profile of this document. This will be "LEGACY" for documents created before color management was launched.

---

### appendChild(child: [PageNode](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/)): void

Adds a new page to the end of the `children` array.

---

### insertChild(index: number, child: [PageNode](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/)): void

Adds a new page at the specified index in the `children` array.

---

Searches the immediate children of this node (i.e. all page nodes, not including their children). Returns all pages for which `callback` returns true.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/DocumentNode-findchildren/)

---

Searches the immediate children of this node (i.e. all page nodes, not including their children). Returns the first page for which `callback` returns true.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/DocumentNode-findchild/)

---

Searches the entire document tree. Returns all nodes for which `callback` returns true.

If the manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, you must first call [`figma.loadAllPagesAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#loadallpagesasync) to access this function.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/DocumentNode-findall/)

---

Searches this entire page (this node's children, its children's children, etc.). Returns the first node for which `callback` returns true.

If the manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, you must first call [`figma.loadAllPagesAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#loadallpagesasync) to access this function.

### findAllWithCriteria<T extends NodeType[]>(criteria: [FindAllCriteria](/plugin-docs/api/FindAllCriteria/)<T>): Array<{ type: T[number] } & ([PageNode](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/) | [SceneNode](/plugin-docs/api/nodes/#SceneNode))>

Searches the entire document tree. Returns all nodes that satisfy all of specified criteria.

If the manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, you must first call [`figma.loadAllPagesAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#loadallpagesasync) to access this function.

Similar to [`findAllWithCriteria`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-findallwithcriteria/) with the main difference being that this searches all the nodes in the document, which also includes [`PageNode`](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/) objects.

---

Searches the entire document tree. Returns all widget nodes that match the provided `widgetId`.

If the manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, you must first call [`figma.loadAllPagesAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#loadallpagesasync) to access this function.

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

---

### getTopLevelFrame(): [FrameNode](/plugin-docs/api/FrameNode/) | undefined

Returns the top-most frame that contains this node. If the node is not inside a frame, this will return undefined.

# FrameNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/FrameNode/*

The frame node is a container used to define a layout hierarchy. It is similar to `<div>` in HTML. It is different from [`GroupNode`](/plugin-docs/api/GroupNode/), which is closer to a folder for layers. Frames can be created using [`figma.createFrame`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createframe/).

Frames generally have their own size, though the size can be determined by that of its children in the case of auto-layout frames.

> â ï¸ It is possible for a user to convert a frame into a group via the UI, and vice-versa. If you hold onto a node in a long-running plugin, you can't assume its `type` never changes.

Frame properties
----------------

### type: 'FRAME' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "FRAME".

---

Duplicates the frame node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`. Nested components will be cloned as instances who master is the original component.

# GroupNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/GroupNode/*

The group node is a container used to semantically group related nodes. You can think of them as a folder in the layers panel. It is different from [`FrameNode`](/plugin-docs/api/FrameNode/), which defines layout and is closer to a `<div>` in HTML. Groups can be created by grouping existing nodes using [`figma.group`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-group/).

Groups in Figma are always positioned and sized to fit their content. As such, while you can move or resize a group, you should also expect that a group's position and size will change if you change its content. See the [`relativeTransform`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-relativetransform/) page for more details.

In Figma, groups must always have children. A group with no children will delete itself.

> â ï¸ It is possible for a user to convert a frame into a group via the UI, and vice-versa. If you hold onto a node in a long-running plugin, you can't assume its `type` never changes.

Applying constraints to groups
------------------------------

When using the Figma UI, you can [change the constraints](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957734-Apply-Constraints-to-define-how-layers-resize) of a group to control how the group and its children respond when the user resizes them. Under the hood, Figma applies the provided constraints to each child of the group.

To change the constraints of a group via the API, you must iterate through the group's children and apply [`Constraints`](/plugin-docs/api/Constraints/) to each child's `constraints` property:

Applying STRETCH constraints to all children of a group

```
const groupNode = figma.currentPage.selection[0]  
groupNode.children.forEach((child) => {  
  child.constraints = {  
    horizontal: 'STRETCH',  
    vertical: 'STRETCH'  
  }  
})
```

Group properties
----------------

### type: 'GROUP' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "GROUP".

---

Duplicates the group node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`. Nested components will be cloned as instances who master is the original component.

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

The name of the layer that appears in the layers panel. Calling `figma.root.name` will return the name, read-only, of the current file.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Removes this node and **all of its children** from the document.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-remove/)

---

### [setRelaunchData](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)(data: { [command: string]: string }): void

Sets state on the node to show a button and description when the node is selected. Clears the button and description when `relaunchData` is `{}`.

In Figma and Dev Mode, this shows up in the properties panel. In FigJam, this shows up in the property menu. See [here](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/#example-figma-design-ui) for examples.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

---

### getRelaunchData(): { [command: string]: string }

Retreives the reluanch data stored on this node using [`setRelaunchData`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

---

### isAsset: boolean [readonly]

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

---

### getTopLevelFrame(): [FrameNode](/plugin-docs/api/FrameNode/) | undefined

Returns the top-most frame that contains this node. If the node is not inside a frame, this will return undefined.

This function will only work in Figma Design and will throw an error if called in FigJam or Slides.

---

# HighlightNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/HighlightNode/*

A HighlightNode is very similar to a VectorNode but they are considered stickables and "stick" to nodes that they are positioned on top of. They are created using the highlighter tool in FigJam.

HighlightNode properties
------------------------

### type: 'HIGHLIGHT' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "HIGHLIGHT"

---

Duplicates the highlight node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

Exposes a complete, but more complex representation of vectors as a network of edges between vectices. See [`VectorNetwork`](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNetwork/).

If the manifest contains`"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, this property is read-only. Use `setVectorNetworkAsync` to update the value.

---

### setVectorNetworkAsync(vectorNetwork: [VectorNetwork](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNetwork/)): Promise<void>

Updates the vector network.

---

Exposes a simple, but incomplete representation of vectors as path. See [`VectorPaths`](/plugin-docs/api/VectorPath/)

---

Whether the vector handles are mirrored or independent.

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

The name of the layer that appears in the layers panel. Calling `figma.root.name` will return the name, read-only, of the current file.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Removes this node and **all of its children** from the document.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-remove/)

---

### [setRelaunchData](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)(data: { [command: string]: string }): void

Sets state on the node to show a button and description when the node is selected. Clears the button and description when `relaunchData` is `{}`.

In Figma and Dev Mode, this shows up in the properties panel. In FigJam, this shows up in the property menu. See [here](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/#example-figma-design-ui) for examples.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

---

### getRelaunchData(): { [command: string]: string }

Retreives the reluanch data stored on this node using [`setRelaunchData`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

---

### isAsset: boolean [readonly]

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

---

### getTopLevelFrame(): [FrameNode](/plugin-docs/api/FrameNode/) | undefined

Returns the top-most frame that contains this node. If the node is not inside a frame, this will return undefined.

This function will only work in Figma Design and will throw an error if called in FigJam or Slides.

---

Plugin data properties
----------------------

# InstanceNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/InstanceNode/*

Instances are a copy of a component (see [`ComponentNode`](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentNode/)). They will always be automatically updated if a component is modified. Instances can be created using the [`createInstance`](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentNode/#createinstance) method on any component node.

Updating an `InstanceNode` when a `ComponentNode` changes has the potential to be slow. Try to avoid access patterns that involve alternating between writing to a `ComponentNode` and then reading from an `InstanceNode` of that `ComponentNode`.

Instance properties
-------------------

### type: 'INSTANCE' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "INSTANCE"

---

Duplicates the instance node. The new instance has the same main component. By default, the duplicate's parent is `figma.currentPage`.

---

### getMainComponentAsync(): Promise<[ComponentNode](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentNode/) | null>

The component that this instance reflects. This could be a remote, read-only component. This can be set to turn this instance into a different component. On nested instances (instances inside other instances), setting this value clears all overrides and performs nested instance swapping.

---

The component that this instance reflects. This could be a remote, read-only component. This can be set to turn this instance into a different component. On nested instances (instances inside other instances), setting this value clears all overrides and performs nested instance swapping.

If the plugin manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, this property is **write-only**. Use [`getMainComponentAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/InstanceNode/#getmaincomponentasync) to read the value.

---

Swaps this instance's current main component with `componentNode` and preserves overrides using the same heuristics as instance swap in the Figma editor UI. Note that we may update these override preservation heuristics from time to time.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/InstanceNode-swapcomponent/)

---

### setProperties(properties: { [propertyName: string]: string | boolean | [VariableAlias](/plugin-docs/api/VariableAlias/) }): void

Sets the component properties and values for this instance. `propertyName` corresponds to the names returned by `componentPropertyDefinitions` and should be suffixed with `'#'` and a unique ID for `'TEXT'`, `'BOOLEAN'`, and `'INSTANCE_SWAP'` properties. In the case of name collision, this function prioritizes updating the `'VARIANT'` type properties. Existing properties that are non-specified in the function will maintain their current value.

---

Component properties and values for this instance. If conflicting property names are encountered, prioritizes showing `'VARIANT'` type properties.

---

Detaches the given instance from its component. Returns the frame node that results from detaching the instance. For nested instances (instances inside of other instances), also detaches all ancestors nodes that

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

# InteractiveSlideElementNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/InteractiveSlideElementNode/*

InteractiveSlideElementNode
===========================

Interactive Slide Elements are interactive elements supported in Slides.
Currently, we have five types of interactivity: `POLL`, `EMBED`, `FACEPILE`, `ALIGNMENT`, and `YOUTUBE`.
These cannot be created by the Plugin API.
Their position can be read and manipulated, but nothing about the data that powers them can be modified through the Plugin API.

Interactive Slide Element properties
------------------------------------

### type: 'INTERACTIVE\_SLIDE\_ELEMENT' [readonly]

# PolygonNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/PolygonNode/*

The polygon node allows you to create a regular convex polygon with three or more sides. Polygons can be created using [`figma.createPolygon`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createpolygon/).

Polygon properties
------------------

### type: 'POLYGON' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "POLYGON"

---

Duplicates the polygon node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

### pointCount: number

Number of sides of the polygon. Must be an integer >= 3.

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Removes this node and **all of its children** from the document.

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

# RectangleNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/RectangleNode/*

The rectangle is one of the most commonly used shapes in Figma. A notable feature it has over other kinds of shapes is the ability to specify independent corner radius values. Rectangles can be created using [`figma.createRectangle`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createrectangle/).

Rectangle properties
--------------------

### type: 'RECTANGLE' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "RECTANGLE"

---

Duplicates the rectangle node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

# SliceNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/SliceNode/*

A slice is an invisible object with a bounding box, represented as dashed lines in the editor. Its purpose is to allow you to export a specific part of a document. Generally, the only thing you will do with a slice is to add an [`exportSettings`](/plugin-docs/api/SliceNode/#exportsettings) and export its content via [`exportAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-exportasync/). Slices can be created using [`figma.createSlice`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createslice/).

Slice properties
----------------

### type: 'SLICE' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "SLICE"

---

Duplicates the slice node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

The name of the layer that appears in the layers panel. Calling `figma.root.name` will return the name, read-only, of the current file.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Removes this node and **all of its children** from the document.

### isAsset: boolean [readonly]

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

# SlideNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/SlideNode/*

A Slide is the fundamental building block of the Slides product.
It is a 1920x1080 frame that is non-resizable, non-rotatable, and cannot undergo any other transformations.
Users add content to Slides, and those slides are presented in the presentation.

Slides can be created using [`figma.createSlide`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createslide/).

We currently do not support Slides being top level nodes on the Canvas; Slides must be direct children of Slide Rows.

Slide properties
----------------

### type: 'SLIDE' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "SLIDE"

---

Create a copy of this node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

Get the [`SlideTransition`](/plugin-docs/api/SlideTransition/) of the slide node.

---

### setSlideTransition(transition: [SlideTransition](/plugin-docs/api/SlideTransition/)): void

Set the [`SlideTransition`](/plugin-docs/api/SlideTransition/) of the slide node.

---

### isSkippedSlide: boolean

Read and set whether or not the slide is skipped in the presentation.

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

The name of the layer that appears in the layers panel. Calling `figma.root.name` will return the name, read-only, of the current file.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

# SlideRowNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/SlideRowNode/*

Slide Rows are children of the Slide Grid node.
Slide Rows are also neither selectable nor editable within the UI.
The only way you can manipulate Slide Rows are to interface with their children, which are all Slides.
We currently do not support Slide Rows being top level nodes on the Canvas; Slide Rows must be direct children of the Slide Grid.

Slide Rows can be created using [`figma.createSlideRow`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createsliderow/).

Slide Row properties

# StampNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/StampNode/*

Stamps are nodes that are inserted by users into the canvas via the Stamp Wheel. Use the stamp's `name` property to tell what type of stamp it is. When created it will be one of:

* `+1`
* `Dot`
* `Heart`
* `Profile`
* `Question`
* `Star`
* `Thumbs down`
* `Thumbs up`

Stamp properties
----------------

### type: 'STAMP' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "STAMP"

---

Duplicates the node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

### getAuthorAsync(): Promise<[BaseUser](/plugin-docs/api/BaseUser/) | null>

Fetches the name, id, and photoUrl of the user that created the Stamp. Note that this can return null
if the stamp was created before July 2022 or if the user is currently not connected to the internet.

`fileusers` must be specified in the permissions array in `manifest.json` to access this function.

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Removes this node and **all of its children** from the document.

# StarNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/StarNode/*

The star node allows you to create a star with a set number of points. Stars can be created using [`figma.createStar`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createstar/).

Star properties
---------------

### type: 'STAR' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "STAR"

---

Duplicates the star node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

### pointCount: number

Number of "spikes", or outer points of the star. Must be an integer >= 3.

---

### innerRadius: number

The percentage value that defines the acuteness of the star's angles. This value must be between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.

Contrary to cornerRadius, which controls the outer corners of the star, innerRadius controls the inner rounded corners of the star. A value closer to 0 makes the angles on each point more acute, resulting in a more "spiky" look. A value closer to 1 makes the star closer to a Polygon node. A value equals 1 means that the node is a regular polygon with 2 \* pointCount edges.

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Removes this node and **all of its children** from the document.

In Figma and Dev Mode, this shows up in the properties panel. In FigJam, this shows up in the property menu. See [here](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/#example-figma-design-ui) for examples.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

---

### getRelaunchData(): { [command: string]: string }

Retreives the reluanch data stored on this node using [`setRelaunchData`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

---

### isAsset: boolean [readonly]

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

---

### getTopLevelFrame(): [FrameNode](/plugin-docs/api/FrameNode/) | undefined

Returns the top-most frame that contains this node. If the node is not inside a frame, this will return undefined.

This function will only work in Figma Design and will throw an error if called in FigJam or Slides.

# TextNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/TextNode/*

The text node represents text where both the whole node or individual character ranges can have properties such as color (fills), font size, font name, etc.

When working with text nodes, there are a lot of things to consider, including mixed styles, loading fonts, and missing fonts. Please refer to the [Working with Text](/plugin-docs/working-with-text/) page for more information.

Returns whether the text uses a font currently not available to the document.

---

### textAlignHorizontal: 'LEFT' | 'CENTER' | 'RIGHT' | 'JUSTIFIED'

The horizontal alignment of the text with respect to the textbox. Setting this property requires the font the be loaded.

---

### textAlignVertical: 'TOP' | 'CENTER' | 'BOTTOM'

The vertical alignment of the text with respect to the textbox. Setting this property requires the font the be loaded.

---

### [textAutoResize](/plugin-docs/api/properties/TextNode-textautoresize/): 'NONE' | 'WIDTH\_AND\_HEIGHT' | 'HEIGHT' | 'TRUNCATE'

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

The name of the layer that appears in the layers panel. Calling `figma.root.name` will return the name, read-only, of the current file.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

# TextPathNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/TextPathNode/*

Text on a path is available in beta. The API is subject to change.

A text path node allows text to follow along a vector path while maintaining text styling capabilities. Like regular [text nodes](/plugin-docs/api/TextNode/), text paths have styling properties such as color (fills), font size, and font name that can be applied to either the entire node or individual character ranges.

Text paths have a subset of the properties from [Text Nodes](/plugin-docs/api/TextNode/), as well as a few path-specific properties that define the underlying vector geometry. When working with text, there are a lot of things to consider, including mixed styles, loading fonts, and missing fonts. Please refer to the [Working with Text](/plugin-docs/working-with-text/) page for more information.

Text path node properties
-------------------------

### type: 'TEXT\_PATH' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "TEXT\_PATH"

---

Duplicates the text path node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

### hasMissingFont: boolean [readonly]

Returns whether the text uses a font currently not available to the document.

---

### textAlignHorizontal: 'LEFT' | 'CENTER' | 'RIGHT' | 'JUSTIFIED'

The horizontal alignment of the text with respect to the textbox. Setting this property requires the font the be loaded.

---

### textAlignVertical: 'TOP' | 'CENTER' | 'BOTTOM'

The vertical alignment of the text with respect to the textbox. Setting this property requires the font the be loaded.

---

Whether updating the characters in the text node should update the name of the node. If this is set to true, `name` will be auto-derived from `characters`.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/TextPathNode-autorename/)

---

### vectorPaths: [VectorPaths](/plugin-docs/api/VectorPath/#VectorPaths) [readonly]

The vector paths of the text path node.

# TransformGroupNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/TransformGroupNode/*

Transform groups are available in beta. The API is subject to change.

A transform group node has all the properties of a [GroupNode](/plugin-docs/api/GroupNode/).

Transform group properties
--------------------------

### type: 'TRANSFORM\_GROUP' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "TRANSFORM\_GROUP".

---

Duplicates the transform group node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`. Nested components will be cloned as instances who master is the original component.

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

The name of the layer that appears in the layers panel. Calling `figma.root.name` will return the name, read-only, of the current file.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Removes this node and **all of its children** from the document.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-remove/)

---

### [setRelaunchData](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)(data: { [command: string]: string }): void

Sets state on the node to show a button and description when the node is selected. Clears the button and description when `relaunchData` is `{}`.

In Figma and Dev Mode, this shows up in the properties panel. In FigJam, this shows up in the property menu. See [here](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/#example-figma-design-ui) for examples.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

---

### getRelaunchData(): { [command: string]: string }

Retreives the reluanch data stored on this node using [`setRelaunchData`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata/)

---

### isAsset: boolean [readonly]

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

---

### getTopLevelFrame(): [FrameNode](/plugin-docs/api/FrameNode/) | undefined

Returns the top-most frame that contains this node. If the node is not inside a frame, this will return undefined.

This function will only work in Figma Design and will throw an error if called in FigJam or Slides.

---

Plugin data properties
----------------------

### getPluginData(key: string): string

# VectorNode | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/VectorNode/*

The vector node is our most general representation of shape, allowing you to specify individual vertices, segments, and regions. They are typically created in the UI using the pen tool, pencil tool, or when flattening a selection. Learn more about [vector networks on our help page](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450213). Vectors can be created using [`figma.createVector`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createvector/).

Note that similarly to groups, `VectorNode`s' position and size are automatically adjusted to fit its vertices. For example, the positions returned by `vectorPaths` is relative to the vector object position. That position will update as you change the vector content. That means that after setting a value to `vectorPaths`, reading the same value again may give a different result than what you originally set.

### type: 'VECTOR' [readonly]

The type of this node, represented by the string literal "VECTOR"

---

Duplicates the vector node. By default, the duplicate will be parented under `figma.currentPage`.

---

Exposes a complete, but more complex representation of vectors as a network of edges between vectices. See [`VectorNetwork`](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNetwork/).

If the manifest contains`"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, this property is read-only. Use `setVectorNetworkAsync` to update the value.

---

### setVectorNetworkAsync(vectorNetwork: [VectorNetwork](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNetwork/)): Promise<void>

Updates the vector network.

---

Exposes a simple, but incomplete representation of vectors as path. See [`VectorPaths`](/plugin-docs/api/VectorPath/)

---

---

Base node properties
--------------------

### [id](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-id/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-name/)

---

### [removed](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/): boolean [readonly]

Returns true if this node has been removed since it was first accessed. If your plugin stays open for a while and stores references to nodes, you should write your code defensively and check that the nodes haven't been removed by the user.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-removed/)

---

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if youâre building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](/plugin-docs/codegen-plugins/).

# Data Types | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/data-types/*

To assist you with writing your plugin code, we provide a TypeScript typings file for the entire Plugin API.

The typings file is a collection of type and interface declarations you can use for type checking. These declarations represent groups of related properties, parameters, and other data sets youâll interact with.

Youâll see **types** and **interfaces** in a few places:

* To get and set properties on nodes or global objects
* Passed as parameters in a function
* Returned by a method

Types and interfaces come in varying levels of complexity.

* Choose one option from a list of values, like [`BlendMode`](/plugin-docs/api/BlendMode/).
* Support a mixture of required and optional properties. Youâll see a â?â at the end of any optional properties.
* Offer different properties based on the outcome you want to achieve, like [`ConnectorEndpoint`](/plugin-docs/api/ConnectorEndpoint/).
* Support or reference other types and interfaces, like [`Paint`](/plugin-docs/api/Paint/) and [`Effect`](/plugin-docs/api/Effect/).

# Shared Node Properties

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/node-properties/*

Nodes support a range of properties. Some properties are universal, some are shared between node types, and some are unique to specific node types.

On this page, you can explore properties which are available on multiple nodes. Properties appear in alphabetical order, and you can see which nodes each property is supported on.

### absoluteBoundingBox: [Rect](/plugin-docs/api/Rect/) | null [readonly]

The bounds of the node that does not include rendered properties like drop shadows or strokes. The `x` and `y` inside this property represent the absolute position of the node on the page.

---

### absoluteRenderBounds: [Rect](/plugin-docs/api/Rect/) | null [readonly]

The actual bounds of a node accounting for drop shadows, thick strokes, and anything else that may fall outside the node's regular bounding box defined in `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`. The `x` and `y` inside this property represent the absolute position of the node on the page. This value will be `null` if the node is invisible.

---

### absoluteTransform: [Transform](/plugin-docs/api/Transform/) [readonly]

The position of a node relative to its **containing page** as a [`Transform`](/plugin-docs/api/Transform/) matrix.

---

Adds a measurement between two nodes in the current page.

Measurements are always between a start and end node. The side indicates which edge of the node to draw the measurement from.

Measurements can only go on the same axis, i.e. from side `"LEFT"` -> `"LEFT"`, `"LEFT"` -> `"RIGHT"`, `"TOP"` -> `"BOTTOM"` etc. But not `"LEFT"` -> `"TOP"`.

See the [Measurement type](/plugin-docs/api/Measurement/) for usage examples.

This method is only available in Dev Mode. You can check the editor type of your plugin to know if the user is in Dev Mode or not:

```
if (figma.editorType === 'dev') {  
    
}
```

---

### annotations: ReadonlyArray<[Annotation](/plugin-docs/api/Annotation/)>

  }  
  
type Navigation = "NAVIGATE" | "SWAP" | "OVERLAY" | "SCROLL_TO" | "CHANGE_TO"
```

A prototyping `Action` describes interactivity in prototypes. Specifically, "what happens?" upon a [`Trigger`](/plugin-docs/api/Trigger/).

"BACK" action
-------------

This action navigates to the previously opened frame by popping the navigation history.

"CLOSE" action
--------------

This action closes the current topmost overlay (applicable only on overlays).

"URL" action
------------

This action opens an external URL specified in the `url: string` parameter. If `openInNewTab: boolean` is set, a new browser tab will be opened.

This action alters the playing status of all video fills on the destination node. If `destinationId` is not set, then it will update video fills on the current node.

`mediaAction: MediaAction` determines

* `"PLAY"`: Plays the video.
* `"PAUSE"`: Pauses the video.
* `"TOGGLE_PLAY_PAUSE"`: Plays the video if it is paused, and pauses the video if it is playing.
* `"MUTE"`: Mutes the video.
* `"UNMUTE"`: Unmutes the video.
* `"TOGGLE_MUTE_UNMUTE`"`: Mutes the video if it is unmuted, and unmutes the video if it is muted.
* `"SKIP_FORWARD"`: Jumps forward in time in the video. An `amountToSkip` must be provided (in seconds).
* `"SKIP_BACKWARD"`: Jumps backward in time in the video. An `amountToSkip` must be provided (in seconds).
* `"SKIP_TO"`: Jumps to a specific timestamp in the video. A `newTimestamp` must be provided (in seconds).

"SET\_VARIABLE" action
----------------------

Variables are stored values that represent design attributes or saved states. They can be string, number, color, or boolean value types. This action can set and modify the values of variables in prototypes.

* `variableId`: string: The variable ID of an existing variable that an action will modify.
* `variableValue`: `VariableData`: The value we want to set variableId during the prototyping. The value can be a boolean, float, string, color, variable or expression.

Important data types:

* `VariableDataType`: Defines the types of data a VariableData object can hold

```
type VariableDataType = 'BOOLEAN' | 'FLOAT' | 'STRING' | 'VARIABLE_ALIAS' | 'COLOR' | 'EXPRESSION'
```

* `VariableResolvedDataType`: Defines the types of data a VariableData object can eventually equal

```
type VariableResolvedDataType = 'BOOLEAN' | 'COLOR' | 'FLOAT' | 'STRING'
```

* `ExpressionFunction`: Defines the list of operators available to use in an Expression

```
type ExpressionFunction =  
  | 'ADDITION'  
  | 'SUBTRACTION'  
  | 'MULTIPLICATION'  
  | 'DIVISION'  
  | 'EQUALS'  
  | 'NOT_EQUAL'  
  | 'LESS_THAN'  
  | 'LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL'  
  | 'GREATER_THAN'  
  | 'GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL'  
  | 'AND'  
  | 'OR'  
  | 'VAR_MODE_LOOKUP'  
  | 'NEGATE'  
  | 'NOT'
```

* `VariableData`: Defines an object which contains a value, VariableDataType and VariableResolvedDataType.

```
interface VariableData = {  
  type?: VariableDataType  
  resolvedType?: VariableResolvedDataType  
  value?: number | boolean | string | RGB | RGBA | VariableAlias | Expression  
}
```

* `Expression`: Defines the [Expression](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15253194385943) object, which contains a list of `VariableData` objects strung together by operators (`ExpressionFunction`). This is essentially just a mathematical statement.

```
interface Expression {  
  expressionFunction: ExpressionFunction  
  expressionArguments: VariableData[]  
}
```

*Note that the `Expression` and `VariableData` objects can be recursive*

Example of creating an expression with strings

```
const stringExpression = {  
  expressionArguments: [  
    {  
      resolvedType: 'STRING',  
      type: 'VARIABLE_ALIAS',  
      value: {  
        type: 'VARIABLE_ALIAS',  
        id: "$StringVariableID",  
      },  
    },  
    {  
      resolvedType: 'STRING',  
      type: 'STRING',  
      value: " Figma",  
    }  
  ],  
  expressionFunction: 'ADDITION',  
}
```

Example of creating a Set Variable action using the expression from above

```
const value = {  
  resolvedType: 'STRING',  
  type: 'EXPRESSION',  
  value: stringExpression  
}  
const setStringVariableAction = {  
  type: 'SET_VARIABLE',  
  variableId: "$StringVariableID",  
  variableValue: value,  
}
```

"SET\_VARIABLE\_MODE" action
----------------------------

Variable modes represent the different contexts of our designs. If a variable collection has multiple modes, then we can switch modes on layers and elements to quickly change designs for different contexts.

This action can switch the selected mode for a given collection at a page level.

* `variableCollectionId`: string: The variable collection ID of an existing variable collection.
* `variableModeId`: string: The variable mode ID of a mode that exists in the corresponding variable collection, which the action will switch to.

Example of creating a set variable mode reaction on a frame

```
const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("collection")  
const newModeId = collection.addMode("mode 2")  
  
const setModeAction = {  
    type: 'SET_VARIABLE_MODE',  
    variableCollectionId: collection.id,  
    variableModeId: newModeId,  
}  
const reactions = [];  
reactions.push({  
    "actions": [setModeAction],  
    "trigger": {  
          "type": "ON_CLICK"  
    }  
});  
  
  
  
const hotspot = figma.createFrame()  
await hotspot.setReactionsAsync(reactions);  
console.log(hotspot.reactions)
```

"CONDITIONAL" action
--------------------

This action checks if a condition is met before performing certain actions by using an if/else conditional statement.

* `conditionalBlocks`: `ConditionalBlock[]`: Either the if or else conditional blocks. The if block contains a condition to check. If that condition is met then it will run those list of actions, else it will run the actions in the else block.

Important data type:

```
type ConditionalBlock = {  
  condition?: VariableData  
  actions: Action[]  
}
```

Example of creating a condition with multiple expressions

```
const numberEvaluationExpression = {  
  expressionArguments: [  
    {  
      resolvedType: "FLOAT",  
      type: "VARIABLE_ALIAS",  
      value: {  
        type: 'VARIABLE_ALIAS',  
        id: "$NumberVariableID",  
      },  
    },  
    {  
      resolvedType: "FLOAT",  
      type: "FLOAT",  
      value: 10  
    }  
  ],  
  expressionFunction: "GREATER_THAN"  
}  
  
  
const conditionData = {  
  resolvedType: "BOOLEAN",  
  type: "EXPRESSION",  
  value: {  
    expressionArguments: [  
      {  
        resolvedType: "BOOLEAN",  
        type: "EXPRESSION",  
        value: numberEvaluationExpression  
      },  
      {  
        resolvedType: "BOOLEAN",  
        type: "VARIABLE_ALIAS",  
        value: {  
          type: 'VARIABLE_ALIAS',  
          id: "$BooleanVariableID",  
        },  
      }  
    ],  
    expressionFunction: "AND",  
  },  
}
```

Example of creating ConditionalBlocks with the condition from above

```
const navigateAction1 = {  
  type: 'NODE',  
  navigation: 'NAVIGATE',  
  transition: null,  
  destinationId: "$Frame1ID",  
}  
  
const navigateAction2 = {  
  type: 'NODE',  
  navigation: 'NAVIGATE',  
  transition: null,  
  destinationId: "$Frame2ID",  
}  
  
const conditionalIfBlock = {  
  condition: conditionData,  
  actions: [navigateAction1],  
}  
  
const conditionalElseBlock = {  
  actions: [navigateAction2],  
}
```

Example of creating a Conditional action with the ConditionalBlocks from above

```
const conditionalAction = {  
  type: 'CONDITIONAL',  
  conditionalBlocks: [conditionalIfBlock, conditionalElseBlock],  
}
```

"NODE" action
-------------

This action navigates to a new node.

`destinationId: string | null`: The ID of the destination node being navigated to. This may be null when invalid (e.g. points to a deleted node).

`navigation: Navigation`: The method of navigation. The possible values are:

* `"NAVIGATE"`: Replaces the current screen with the destination, also closing all overlays.
* `"OVERLAY"`: Opens the destination as an overlay on the current screen.
* `"SWAP"`: On an overlay, replaces the current (topmost) overlay with the destination. On a top-level frame, behaves the same as `"NAVIGATE"` except that no entry is added to the navigation history.
* `"SCROLL_TO"`: Scrolls to the destination on the current screen.
* `"CHANGE_TO"`: Changes the closest ancestor instance of source node to the specified variant.

`transition: Transition | null`: An animated transition when navigating, if any. See the [`Transition`](/plugin-docs/api/Transition/) object type.

`preserveScrollPosition?: boolean`: Whether the scroll offsets of any scrollable elements in the current screen or overlay are preserved when navigating to the destination. This is applicable only if the layout of both the current frame and its destination are the same.

`overlayRelativePosition?: Vector`: Applicable only when `navigation` is `"OVERLAY"` and the destination is a frame with `overlayPosition` equal to `"MANUAL"`. This value represents the offset by which the overlay is opened relative to this node.

`resetVideoPosition?: boolean`: When true, all videos within the destination frame will reset their memorized playback position to 00:00 before starting to play.

`resetScrollPosition?: boolean`: Whether the scroll offsets of any scrollable elements in the current screen or overlay are reset when navigating to the destination. This is applicable only if the layout of both the current frame and its destination are the same.

`resetInteractiveComponents?: boolean`: Whether the state of any interactive components in the current screen or overlay are reset when navigating to the destination. This is applicable if there are interactive components in the destination frame.

# ExportSettings | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/ExportSettings*

Figma has four types of exports: images, SVGs, PDFs, and REST API JSON.

```
type ExportSettings =  
  | ExportSettingsImage  
  | ExportSettingsSVG  
  | ExportSettingsPDF  
  | ExportSettingsREST
```

`ExportSettings` is used for the [`exportSettings`](/plugin-docs/api/node-properties/#exportsettings) property and the [`exportAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-exportasync/) function.

Common properties
-----------------

### contentsOnly?: boolean [readonly]

Whether only the contents of the node are exported, or any overlapping layer in the same area. Defaults to `true`.

---

### useAbsoluteBounds?: boolean [readonly]

Use the full dimensions of the node regardless of whether or not it is cropped or the space around it is empty. Use this to export text nodes without cropping. Defaults to `false`.

---

### suffix?: string [readonly]

Suffix appended to the file name when exporting. Defaults to empty string.

---

### colorProfile?: 'DOCUMENT' | 'SRGB' | 'DISPLAY\_P3\_V4' [readonly]

Color profile of the export.

Defaults to `'DOCUMENT'`

* `"DOCUMENT"`: Use the color profile of [`documentColorProfile`](/plugin-docs/api/DocumentNode/#documentcolorprofile).
* `"SRGB"`: Use sRGB colors. This was the previous behavior of Figma before [color management](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039825114).
* `"DISPLAY_P3_V4"`: Use Display P3 colors.

---

ExportSettingsImage
-------------------

### format: 'JPG' | 'PNG' [readonly]

The string literal representing the export format.
When reading [`exportSettings`](/plugin-docs/api/node-properties/#exportsettings), always check the `format` before reading other properties.

---

Constraint on the image size when exporting.

```
interface ExportSettingsConstraints {  
  type: "SCALE" | "WIDTH" | "HEIGHT"  
  value: number  
}
```

Defaults to 100% of image size `{ type: "SCALE", value: 1 }`.

* `"SCALE"`: The size of the exported image is proportional to the size of the exported layer in Figma. A `value` of 1 means the export is 100% of the layer size.
* `"WIDTH"`: The exported image is scaled to have a fixed width of `value`.
* `"HEIGHT"`: The exported image is scaled to have a fixed height of `value`.

---

SVG export
----------

[`ExportSettingsSVG`](#exportsettingssvg) controls SVG export settings.
The [`exportAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-exportasync/) function supports an additional [`ExportSettingsSVGString`](#exportsettingssvgstring) type for exporting a node to an SVG string.
Both types have the below common properties.

### Common SVG export properties

### svgOutlineText?: boolean [readonly]

Whether text elements are rendered as outlines (vector paths) or as `<text>` elements in SVGs. Defaults to `true`.

Rendering text elements as outlines guarantees that the text looks exactly the same in the SVG as it does in the browser/inside Figma.

Exporting as `<text>` allows text to be selectable inside SVGs and generally makes the SVG easier to read. However, this relies on the browserâs rendering engine which can vary between browsers and/or operating systems. As such, visual accuracy is not guaranteed as the result could look different than in Figma.

---

### svgIdAttribute?: boolean [readonly]

Whether to include layer names as ID attributes in the SVG. This can be useful as a way to reference particular elements, but increases the size of the SVG. SVG features that require IDs to function, such as masks and gradients, will always have IDs. Defaults to `false`.

---

### svgSimplifyStroke?: boolean [readonly]

Whether to export inside and outside strokes as an approximation of the original to simplify the output. Otherwise, it uses a more precise but more bloated masking technique. This is needed because SVGs only support center strokes. Defaults to `true`.

---

### ExportSettingsSVG

### format: 'SVG' [readonly]

The string literal "SVG" representing the export format.
When reading [`exportSettings`](/plugin-docs/api/node-properties/#exportsettings), always check the `format` before reading other properties.

---

### ExportSettingsSVGString

This is used only by [`exportAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-exportasync/), and is the same as `ExportSettingsSVG` above, but exports the node as an `"<svg>...</svg>"` string rather than a Uint8Array.

### format: 'SVG\_STRING' [readonly]

The string literal "SVG\_STRING" representing the export format.

---

ExportSettingsPDF
-----------------

### format: 'PDF' [readonly]

The string literal "PDF" representing the export format.
When reading [`exportSettings`](/plugin-docs/api/node-properties/#exportsettings), always check the `format` before reading other properties.

---

ExportSettingsREST
------------------

This returns a JSON object in the shape of the response of the <https://api.figma.com/v1/files> endpoint. For more information read about the API [here](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#get-files-endpoint).

### format: 'JSON\_REST\_V1' [readonly]

Returns the equivalent REST API response of hitting the endpoint `https://api.figma.com/v1/files/:file_key/nodes?ids=:id`.

This is useful if you have existing code that uses the REST API that you would like to have work inside a plugin as well. It can also be significantly more perfomant if you need to serialize large groups of nodes and their children.
Here is an example that logs the name of every child in a node using the REST API response:

Using the JSON\_REST\_V1 format

```
function visitChildren(child: Object) {  
  console.log(child.name);  
  if (child.children) {  
    child.children.forEach(visitChildren);

GridTrackSize
-------------

### value?: number

Applicable only on FIXED grid tracks. The size of the track in pixels.
Optional for `FLEX` tracks.
If the setter for this value is called on a `FLEX` track, the track will be converted to a `FIXED` track.

---

### type: 'FLEX' | 'FIXED'

The type of the grid track. `FLEX` indicates that the track will grow to fill the available space in the container (evenly divided among all flex tracks in the grid), while `FIXED` indicates that the track will have a fixed size.

# Image | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/Image*

This object is handle to an image stored in Figma.

A common misconception is that Figma has image layers. What we have instead is image fills [`ImagePaint`](/plugin-docs/api/Paint/). In fact, dragging an image into Figma creates a rectangle with an image fill. This allows assigning images as strokes too, but it means that creating an image *on the canvas* requires creating a rectangle (or other shape), following by adding an image fill to it.

New images can be created via [`figma.createImage`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createimage/) from a `Uint8Array` containing the bytes of the image file. Existing images can be read via [`figma.getImageByHash`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#getimagebyhash).

Figma supports PNG, JPEG, and GIF. Images can be up to 4096 pixels (4K) in width and height.

See this [example of working with images](/plugin-docs/working-with-images/).

Image
-----

### hash: string [readonly]

A unique hash of the contents of the image file.

---

### getBytesAsync(): Promise<Uint8Array>

The contents of the corresponding image file. This returns a promise because the image may still need to be downloaded (images in Figma are loaded separately from the rest of the document).

---

### getSizeAsync(): Promise<{ width: number; height: number }>

The width and height of the image in pixels. This returns a promise because the image may still need to be downloaded (images in Figma are loaded separately from the rest of the document).

# LabelSublayer | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/LabelSublayer*

LabelSublayer (on [ConnectorNodes](/plugin-docs/api/ConnectorNode/)) acts like pared-back version of a rectangle node. It is used to provide a background on text.

Basic traits
------------

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-parent/)

---

> Tip: `parent` will always return a [ConnectorNode](/plugin-docs/api/ConnectorNode/)

The paints used to fill the area of the shape. For help on how to change this value, see [Editing Properties](/plugin-docs/editing-properties/).

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-fills/)

---

The id of the [`PaintStyle`](/plugin-docs/api/PaintStyle/) object that the [`fills`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-fills/) property of this node is linked to.

If the manifest contains`"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, this property is read-only. Use `setFillStyleIdAsync` to update the style.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-fillstyleid/)

---

The number of pixels to round the corners of the object by.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-cornerradius/)

---

### topLeftRadius: number

---

### topRightRadius: number

---

### bottomLeftRadius: number

---

### bottomRightRadius: number

---

You can set individual corner radius of each of the four corners of a rectangle node or frame-like node. Similar to `cornerRadius`, these value must be non-negative and can be fractional. If an edge length is less than twice the corner radius, the corner radius for each vertex of the edge will be clamped to half the edge length.

Setting `cornerRadius` sets the property for all four corners. Setting these corners to different values makes `cornerRadius` return `mixed`.

# Measurement | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/Measurement*

Measurements can be added between nodes in Dev Mode to highlight distances.

Measurements can only be added between the following node types: [ComponentNode](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentNode/), [ComponentSetNode](/plugin-docs/api/ComponentSetNode/), [EllipseNode](/plugin-docs/api/EllipseNode/), [FrameNode](/plugin-docs/api/FrameNode/), [InstanceNode](/plugin-docs/api/InstanceNode/), [LineNode](/plugin-docs/api/LineNode/), [PolygonNode](/plugin-docs/api/PolygonNode/), [RectangleNode](/plugin-docs/api/RectangleNode/), [StarNode](/plugin-docs/api/StarNode/), [TextNode](/plugin-docs/api/TextNode/), [VectorNode](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNode/).

You can read, add, edit and remove measurements by using the measurement methods on a [PageNode](/plugin-docs/api/PageNode/).

The value of the measurement displayed can be overridden with the `freeText` field.

Measurement properties
----------------------

```
interface Measurement {  
  id: string  
  start: { node: SceneNode; side: MeasurementSide }  
  end: { node: SceneNode; side: MeasurementSide }  
  offset: MeasurementOffset  
  freeText: string  
}
```

See [MeasurementSide](/plugin-docs/api/MeasurementSide/) and [MeasurementOffset](/plugin-docs/api/MeasurementOffset/) for supported values.

Page node properties
--------------------

Get all measurements in the current page.

Learn more about measurements in the [Help Center](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/20774752502935).

---

Get all measurements pointing to a node in the current page. This includes all measurements whose start *or* end node is the node passed in.

---

Adds a measurement between two nodes in the current page.

Measurements are always between a start and end node. The side indicates which edge of the node to draw the measurement from.

Measurements can only go on the same axis, i.e. from side `"LEFT"` -> `"LEFT"`, `"LEFT"` -> `"RIGHT"`, `"TOP"` -> `"BOTTOM"` etc. But not `"LEFT"` -> `"TOP"`.

See the [Measurement type](/plugin-docs/api/Measurement/) for usage examples.

This method is only available in Dev Mode. You can check the editor type of your plugin to know if the user is in Dev Mode or not:

```
if (figma.editorType === 'dev') {  
    
}
```

---

### editMeasurement(id: string, newValue: { offset: [MeasurementOffset](/plugin-docs/api/MeasurementOffset/); freeText: string }): [Measurement](/plugin-docs/api/Measurement/)

Edit a measurementâs offset.

See the [Measurement type](/plugin-docs/api/Measurement/) for usage examples.

This method is only available in Dev Mode. You can check the editor type of your plugin to know if the user is in Dev Mode or not:

```
if (figma.editorType === 'dev') {  
    
}
```

---

### deleteMeasurement(id: string): void

Delete a measurement.

See the [Measurement type](/plugin-docs/api/Measurement/) for usage examples.

This method is only available in Dev Mode. You can check the editor type of your plugin to know if the user is in Dev Mode or not:

```
if (figma.editorType === 'dev') {  
    
}
```

# Paint | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/Paint*

Figma has five types of paints: solid colors, gradients, images, videos, and patterns (in beta).

```
type Paint =  
  | SolidPaint  
  | GradientPaint

  | VideoPaint  
  | PatternPaint
```

Common properties
-----------------

### visible?: boolean [readonly]

Whether the paint is visible. Defaults to true.

---

### opacity?: number [readonly]

The opacity of the paint. Must be a value between 0 and 1. Defaults to 1.

You can use the [`solidPaint`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-util-solidpaint/) utility function to set both `color` and `opacity` using CSS color strings:

```
// Create a new SolidPaint  
const paint = figma.util.solidPaint('#FF00FF88')  
  
// Modify an existing SolidPaint  
if (node.fills[0].type === 'SOLID') {  
  const updated = figma.util.solidPaint('#FF00FF88', node.fills[0])  
}
```

---

### blendMode?: [BlendMode](/plugin-docs/api/BlendMode/) [readonly]

Determines how the color of this paint blends with the colors underneath it. Defaults to "NORMAL".

---

SolidPaint

### type: 'SOLID' [readonly]

The string literal "SOLID" representing the type of paint this is. Always check the `type` before reading other properties.

---

### color: [RGB](/plugin-docs/api/RGB/) [readonly]

The color of the paint. This does not have a alpha property, use `opacity` instead.

You can use the [`solidPaint`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-util-solidpaint/) utility function to set both `color` and `opacity` using CSS color strings:

```
// Create a new SolidPaint  
const paint = figma.util.solidPaint('#FF00FF88')  
  
// Modify an existing SolidPaint  
if (node.fills[0].type === 'SOLID') {  
  const updated = figma.util.solidPaint('#FF00FF88', node.fills[0])

# SlideTransition | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/SlideTransition*

A `SlideTransition` is a transition, or animation, that is played when navigating between slides in a Figma Slides presentation.

To read the current slide transition:

```
const slideTransition = slideNode.getSlideTransition()
```

To set the slide transition:

```
slideNode.setSlideTransition(slideTransition)
```

If you use the trigger type ON\_CLICK, the delay parameter will be ignored and set to 0.

To clear a slide transition, you can set its transition type to NONE:

```
slideNode.setSlideTransition({  
  style: 'NONE',  
  duration: 0.3,  
  curve: 'EASE_IN',  
  timing: {  
    type: 'ON_CLICK'  
  }  
  })
```

If you want to update the slide transition for every slide in the grid, like the button in UI that says âApply to all slidesâ, you can loop through each slide in the grid.

```
figma.getSlideGrid().flat().forEach(slide => slide.setSlideTransition(transition))
```

Slide Transition properties
---------------------------

### style: 'NONE' | 'DISSOLVE' | 'SLIDE\_FROM\_LEFT' | 'SLIDE\_FROM\_RIGHT' | 'SLIDE\_FROM\_BOTTOM' | 'SLIDE\_FROM\_TOP' | 'PUSH\_FROM\_LEFT' | 'PUSH\_FROM\_RIGHT' | 'PUSH\_FROM\_BOTTOM' | 'PUSH\_FROM\_TOP' | 'MOVE\_FROM\_LEFT' | 'MOVE\_FROM\_RIGHT' | 'MOVE\_FROM\_TOP' | 'MOVE\_FROM\_BOTTOM' | 'SLIDE\_OUT\_TO\_LEFT' | 'SLIDE\_OUT\_TO\_RIGHT' | 'SLIDE\_OUT\_TO\_TOP' | 'SLIDE\_OUT\_TO\_BOTTOM' | 'MOVE\_OUT\_TO\_LEFT' | 'MOVE\_OUT\_TO\_RIGHT' | 'MOVE\_OUT\_TO\_TOP' | 'MOVE\_OUT\_TO\_BOTTOM' | 'SMART\_ANIMATE' [readonly]

The type of slide transition.

---

### duration: number [readonly]

# TextSublayer | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/TextSublayer*

Text sublayer nodes are pared-back versions of text nodes: they have most text properties (except `textAlignVertical` and `textAutoResize`, which are not editable on these nodes' text sublayers), as well as `fills`. They aren't resizable or repositionable.

You set text content as you would for any other text node (e.g. `sticky.text.characters = 'some text'`). As with all other text operations in Figma, you'll need to ensure [fonts are loaded](/plugin-docs/working-with-text/#loading-fonts).

Basic traits
------------

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more â](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-tostring/)

---

Returns the parent of this node, if any. This property is not meant to be directly edited. To reparent, see [`appendChild`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-appendchild/).

# VectorNetwork | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/VectorNetwork*

The `VectorNetwork` API is the advanced way to change the geometry of an object. For the simple (and recommended) way to specify geometry, please look at the [`VectorPath`](/plugin-docs/api/VectorPath/) definition instead.

Vector networks enable Figma to provide better ways of manipulating stroke geometry than other apps. They are essentially a superset of paths; a vector network can represent everything paths can represent while paths canât represent everything a vector network represents.

While paths can only represent chains of segments, vector networks can represent whole graphs of segments. This means more than two segments can connect together at a point. This is more natural to edit (connect anything to anything else) and is useful for preserving caps and joins as the graph is edited.

Vector networks come in three parts: an array of vertices, an array of segments that index into the array of vertices, and an array of regions that index into the array of segments.

Example
-------

Here's the same geometry as the [triangle in the path example](/plugin-docs/api/VectorPath/) `M 0 100 L 100 100 L 50 0 Z`, in vector network representation:

```
node.vectorNetwork = {  
    
  vertices: [  
    { x: 0, y: 100 },  
    { x: 100, y: 100 },  
    { x: 50, y: 0 },  
  ],  
  
    
  segments: [  
    {  
      start: 0,  
      tangentStart: { x: 0, y: 0 },   
      end: 1,  
      tangentEnd: { x: 0, y: 0 },   
    },  
    {  
      start: 1,  
      end: 2,  
    },  
    {  
      start: 2,  
      end: 0,  
    },  
  ],  
  
    
    
  regions: [  
    { windingRule: "NONZERO", loops: [[0, 1, 2]] }  
  ],  
}
```

VectorNetwork
-------------

### vertices: ReadonlyArray<[VectorVertex](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNetwork/#VectorVertex)> [readonly]

Vertices are points in the graph.

---

### segments: ReadonlyArray<[VectorSegment](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNetwork/#VectorSegment)> [readonly]

Segments connect vertices.

---

### regions?: ReadonlyArray<[VectorRegion](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNetwork/#VectorRegion)> [readonly]

Regions are defined by segments and specify that an area is to be filled. Defaults to [].

---

VectorVertex
------------

Each vertex is a point in the graph, defined by its position.

### x: number [readonly]

x position of the vertex relative to the position of the node.

---

### y: number [readonly]

y position of the vertex relative to the position of the node.

---

### strokeCap?: [StrokeCap](/plugin-docs/api/StrokeCap/) [readonly]

Appearance of the end of a stroke. Defaults to the node's property if left unspecified.

---

### strokeJoin?: [StrokeJoin](/plugin-docs/api/StrokeJoin/) [readonly]

Appearance of the join between two segments. Defaults to the node's property if left unspecified.

---

### cornerRadius?: number [readonly]

Corner radius at this vertex. Defaults to the node's property if left unspecified.

---

How two curve handles behave relative to one another. Defaults to the node's property if left unspecified.

---

VectorSegment
-------------

Each segment has a start and an end vertex, referenced by index.

Segments represent both line segments and cubic spline segments. A line segment is just a cubic spline segment where both handles have a tangent of `{x: 0, y: 0}`, which are also the default values of `tangentStart` and `tangentEnd`.

As long as the stroke weight is non-zero, a stroke will appear for every segment in the vector network. *Note* that it does not matter which is the start handle and which is the end handle. Segments are non-directional graph edges.

Each segment must refer to a valid vertex index in both `start` and `end`.

### start: number [readonly]

The index of the vertex that starts this segment.

---

### end: number [readonly]

The index of the vertex that ends this segment.

---

### tangentStart?: [Vector](/plugin-docs/api/Vector/) [readonly]

The tangent on the start side of this segment. Defaults to { x: 0, y: 0 }

---

### tangentEnd?: [Vector](/plugin-docs/api/Vector/) [readonly]

The tangent on the end side of this segment. Defaults to { x: 0, y: 0 }

---

VectorRegion
------------

Each region is essentially the same data as a [`VectorPath`](/plugin-docs/api/VectorPath/); it has a winding rule and one or more loops. A region such as the fill of the letter "o" needs two loops, one for the outside and one for the inside. Each loop is an array of segment indices that specify the segments involved in the loop consecutively as they are encountered around the edge of the loop. Which segment the loop starts on is not important.

A vector network does not need to have any regions. If it does not, all enclosed space, if any, is filled.

If the vector network does have regions, then each region must contain at least one loop, each loop must contain at least one segment, and every segment in every loop must refer to a valid segment index. Additionally, the segments in each loop must form a connected continuous chain. I.e. they should be connected such that you can draw all segments of the loop, in the order they are defined, without lifting the pen and without tracing a segment more times than it is defined in the loop. Forks and gaps are not allowed. However, the order of the `start` and `end` points in the segments do not matter, i.e. the `end` vertex of one segment does not need to match the `start` vertex of the next segment in the loop, but can instead match the `end` vertex of that segment.

A region also may contain an array of `fills`, or a `fillStyleId` which uses the same syntax as the corresponding fields on nodes: ([`fills`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-fills/), [`fillStyleId`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-fillstyleid/)).

### windingRule: [WindingRule](/plugin-docs/api/properties/VectorPath-windingrule/#WindingRule) [readonly]

Winding rule for this region.

---

### loops: ReadonlyArray<ReadonlyArray<number>> [readonly]

List of loops, each of which is a list of indices of `VectorSegment`(s)

---

### fills?: ReadonlyArray<[Paint](/plugin-docs/api/Paint/)> [readonly]

Array of fill paints used on this region.

---

### fillStyleId?: string [readonly]

Style key of fill style applied to this region, if any.

---

# Video | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/Video*

This object is handle to a video stored in Figma.

Like images, instead of video layers, Figma has video fills [`VideoPaint`](/plugin-docs/api/Paint/). In fact, dragging a video into Figma creates a rectangle with an video fill. Creating a video *on the canvas* requires creating a rectangle (or other shape), following by adding a video fill to it.

New videos can be created via [`figma.createVideoAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createvideoasync/) from a `Uint8Array` containing the bytes of the video file.

Figma supports MP4, MOV, and WebM files. Videos can be up to 100 MB in size. Video can only be added to files in a paid Education, Professional, and Organization team. Plugins running on files in free Starter teams can edit existing video in a file but not upload video to it.

Video
-----

### hash: string [readonly]

A unique hash of the contents of the video file.

# BaseStyle | Plugin API

*Source: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/BaseStyle*

[Styles](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039238753-Styles-in-Figma) in Figma define reusable colors, text properties, effects, or layout grids that can be applied to nodes.

Here are the different types of styles, each with their own set of properties:

In the [type declarations](/plugin-docs/api/typings/), each style type is represented with an interface. The most general, `BaseStyle`, is a [union](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types) of these interfaces:

```
type BaseStyle = PaintStyle | TextStyle | EffectStyle | GridStyle
```

Base style properties
---------------------

### id: string [readonly]

The unique identifier of the style in the document the plugin is executing from. You can assign this value via `setFillStyleIdAsync`, `setStrokeStyleIdAsync`, `setTextStyleIdAsync`, etc. to make the node properties reflect that of the style node.

---

### getStyleConsumersAsync(): Promise<[StyleConsumers](/plugin-docs/api/StyleConsumers/)[]>

The consumers of this style. The `fields` in `StyleConsumers` refers to the field where the style is applied (e.g. a PaintStyle can be applied in `setFillStyleIdAsync` or `setStrokeStyleIdAsync`).

---

**DEPRECATED:** Use `getStyleConsumersAsync` instead. Accessing this property will throw an exception if the plugin manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`.

The consumers of this style. The `fields` in `StyleConsumers` refers to the field where the style is applied (e.g. a PaintStyle can be applied in `setFillStyleIdAsync` or `setStrokeStyleIdAsync`).

---

### name: string

---

### remove(): void

Deletes a local style.

---

Plugin data properties
----------------------

### getPluginData(key: string): string

The key to use with [`figma.importComponentByKeyAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#importcomponentbykeyasync), [`figma.importComponentSetByKeyAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#importcomponentsetbykeyasync) and [`figma.importStyleByKeyAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/figma/#importstylebykeyasync). Note that while this key is present on local and published components, you can only import components that are already published.

---

### getPublishStatusAsync(): Promise<[PublishStatus](/plugin-docs/api/PublishStatus/)>

Gets the status of this style/component in the team library.

---

Folders
-------

Styles can be put inside folders (including nested folders) by setting the name of the style to be a delimited path name.
For example, the following code would move a paint style named `Style 1` into a nested folder named `b`. Folder `b` resides in folder `a`.

```
const style = figma.createPaintStyle()   
style.name = "a/b/Style 1"
```

Folder names cannot be empty strings and they are unique within the same hierarchy. Since two nested folders can have the same name when residing in
different parent folders, we refer to folders by their absolute delimited folder name. The following function `getNamePrefix` can be used
to get the absolute folder name given a style name.

```
const getNameParts = (name: string) => {  
  const nameParts = name.split('/').filter((part: string) => !!part)  
  return nameParts.map((part: string) => part.trim())  
}  
  
const getNamePrefix = (name: string): string => {  
  const pathParts = getNameParts(name)  
  pathParts.pop()  
  return pathParts.join('/')  
}
```

# Designer Agent: Tools Encyclopedia (v2.0)

**API Reference:** [Figma Plugin API](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/api-reference/)

**Guiding Principles:** This toolset is governed by the agent's core principles:
*   **Auto Layout First:** Prioritize Auto Layout for all container elements.
*   **Design System as Source of Truth:** Leverage styles, variables, and components.
*   **Component-Driven Architecture:** Build with instances, not detached groups.
*   **Build for Responsiveness:** Use constraints and resizing settings correctly.
*   **Non-Destructive Workflow:** Preserve original layers and properties where possible.

> **Note:** Every multi-step mutation **must** be wrapped in `withUndoGroup`, and significant off-screen mutations **must** be preceded by a call to `scrollAndZoomIntoView`.

### Additional Guidance and Safety Rails

- **Auto Layout vs Positioning**: Prefer container edits (padding, spacing, order) over absolute positioning. For exceptions, set `layoutPositioning = 'ABSOLUTE'` explicitly and document why.
- **Auto Layout Sizing Modes**: Resizing Auto Layout frames can change `primaryAxisSizingMode`/`counterAxisSizingMode`. Prefer setting sizing modes directly (HUG/FILL/FIXED) and use `resize` cautiously. `TextNode.resize` requires `textAutoResize = 'NONE'`.
- **Dynamic Page Loading & Gating**: With `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, use `figma.getNodeByIdAsync` and call `page.loadAsync`/`figma.loadAllPagesAsync` before cross‑page traversal. Some properties are read‑only (e.g., `.reactions`); use the async setter APIs (e.g., `setReactionsAsync`).
- **Instance Mutability**: Many instance fields are read‑only unless exposed by the main component. Prefer `setComponentProperties` for variant swaps and boolean/text props. Consider editing the main component when appropriate.
- **Prototyping Reactions**: Read existing `reactions` first and update immutably. Under `dynamic-page`, do not assign `.reactions` directly; always call `setReactionsAsync`. Ensure destinations exist and required `Transition` fields are provided (especially for overlays and animated navigations).
- **Variables Binding Limits**: Not all fields are bindable. Use `setBoundVariableForPaint` for paints/gradients and `setRangeBoundVariable` for text ranges. Load fonts for any ranges being updated.
- **Fonts Discipline**: Load every `FontName` present in affected ranges before `characters` or range styling APIs.
- **Locked/Hidden Nodes**: Mutation tools should check `locked`/`visible` and fail with helpful errors instead of no‑ops.
- **Immutable Arrays**: Replace arrays immutably (`fills`, `strokes`, `effects`, `layoutGrids`): copy → modify → set.
- **Undo Semantics**: One plugin run collapses into a single undo step by default. Call `figma.commitUndo()` to intentionally split the undo history into multiple steps.
- **Error Semantics**: Tools should return a canonical error object `{ code, message, nodeId?, property? }` for failed operations to support the Assess/Correct loop.
- **Ungroup Caution**: Ungrouping can remove container semantics (especially Frames/Auto Layout). Prefer editing layout properties; ungroup only with intent and archive first.
